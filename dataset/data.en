Was preoccupied with American transports down the East coast.
Too interested in yourself to get to know me?
With a divided loyalty,
2 things at once you make mistakes!
Being able to do two things at once is a big part of success.
And it pleases me to think you liked going to bed with me.
I thought I'd have a rich life
Climb as fast as you can.
An idea transcended into life.
Prep for next week's trial.
Fully prepared to have sex for the first time.
Lt goes to the fishing village
Lt says to the back alley!
Just trying to make a better life for herself.
She was committed to getting out of here, moving on with her life.
Always had concern for the country,
And to devote life to seeking to recover health.
In favor of more.
Just carrying out my duties as a wife as a mother,
She dedicated her life to helping others.
With the single - minded task of doing as much work.
So that I could focus on finding a way
All work and no play?
A pure fighting machine with only a desire to win a war that someone else lost.
And just wants to find Molly millions.
Who are always trying to tear the boy down.
They just give you whatever samples came with the best gifts.
It was easy just to want to save her.
All you want to do is kiss them .
Everything is strictly business. That's a good idea.
Thinking about us.
Who just want to lie down.
I just wanted to get out of there.
With a huge heart who only worries about what he could do for other people.
All she wants is this room.
Because they just want to sleep with a girl
Just wanted to get away from him.
She kept trying to get closer and closer and closer.
When all I wanted was a fresh start.
Someone who has one heart to love only one person
Pretty much everything.
From a womanish attachment to France.
A gent of good intent
Ready and willing to sell them a drug.
Multitasking? Like you wouldn't believe.
Devoted mom.
Seeking power and fortune.
And eager to inflict their fate on others.
Praying for my death.
In hopes that through division
Thinking about singing that song sitting at the piano.
Pet the sweaty.
Married to the mission.
Between training you and getting ready for the fight, it slipped my mind.
Always keeps thinking of Lianzhu

With all intentions of living a peaceful life with his wife and daughters.
With a need to know what love is.
A vampire wannabe.
All she wants now is to get home.

Are obsessed with finding a place to sit down.
Who's been obsessed about finding
Looks like you're gonna make that U.N.thing happen.
He's so hot for me, we give him a whiff of my ass, he 'll crawl right in it.
He's so hot for me, we give him a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.
I want to be in the ad game.
Groupies all over you.
Yellow slants who have tried to kill me on many occasions?
Has every intention of our destruction?
The desperate mother who risks everything
You try to take him out with one punch.
Think of how much you want to kill. That's all.
Obsessing about things that don't matter.
I wanted my pills.
All but accused me of murder.
With his heart set on the closest of aye - aye encounters,
Just wanted to get inside your pants.
The vengeful husband and the neglected daughter.
Was knowing at the end of that I would see you.
Women who are obsessed with cleaning their kitchens
Just beIieve in the ball, Jake. And throw yourseIf.
Just waiting to be put out of your misery.
Searching for ways to fill her empty social life.
She was desperate for money.
All we ever dreamed of was having a real family.
Your obsession over making partner,
I only ever wanted to be with him.
Who worked hard trying to bring criminals to justice.
And just wanted to work and make it work,
That would like nothing more than to hijack my master's cargo.
Went bent on... On retribution.
Commodity futures trading Commission wanted to regulate credit default swaps.
Only thinking of making you happy.
Just trying to keep up with him.
Reaching for the moon
About charity and family.
That's what it's like for a struggling actress.
Getting all wrapped up in the asset?
Just making music.
Only our vengeance.
I expect my loving wife to be there.
Looking for some ghetto adventure,
It is a strange thing to wish to die.
So that daddy death wish here could down a bottle of isopropyl.
To believe when Alexander looked you in the eye, you could do anything.
Her willfully thought
Intensive research on his number theories.
Fervently making sure to give each number key a specific forceful push.
With what they were doing in there.
Planning the nationals send off party
I focused on helping other people.
Which could never be determined.
And feeding your family becomes a federal offense.
Attempting to better your social status at school
Pretty much devoted his life to seeing the Sinclairs put away.
What he wanted was a kingdom of himseIf
And the will to take you down.
You're the one who wanted to send her there.
Just make the picture good.
She has her mind set on waiting for the emperor
He wants to run the Federation of crime?
Went around insisting that a witch had turned him into a vampire.
That would keep you in your accustomed places.
Just trying to get to work.
I'm only dancing.
In the pursuit of your career ambitions?
Dying to see you
And dying to see you but it shouldn't be I like this
I sent him to study in England
He's always searching for what's right on the edge
Determined to prevent a radical
One must unite with one
Put up with too much.
I'll call you the instant things let up. Okay.
When the mouth starts going there goes the whole day.
A devoted husband, loving father,
One watch of type Orient.
Move along. Find me.
Show me. Look.
Come on.
One rag's not enough!
So a terminally ill unsub targets a man who came back from the dead and then starts killing repeatedly.
Come on. Not the dog.
A soap bar and a shirt if you got it.
Quick, this way. All right. Charge!
A moment of weakness, right?
It takes one mistake to change your life.
I could have been in there with them
I could wipe them out with a thought.
Suddenly the skillet was in my hand and I swung.
Your decision, your terms.
And abracadabra energy.
What am I supposed to do? - hold this pen.
What's wrong, Katarina? - nothing.
What was that all about? No sense of humor.
What do you think? - it's nice.
What that bitch say? Each one do what?
Who are gonna dismember me when they find out it's gone.
Kills six more people, and calls back
Outraged Tai lung laid waste to the valley.
And starts cutting people.
We 'll be in trouble,
And in a rage I took my revenge.
If you think,
Thinking sucks.
We rush, we make a mistake
An er nurse. I'm not that into her.
How much in total?
And when you do some of those agents are gonna be alive,
Congratulations. Sir. My God.
Breath.
Would destroy his show - business career in an instant.
We at least are still alive
Breathing your last?
Yet lives?
The last remnants of human civilization.
A walking dead trying to call it an end
Only just. Then there is still time to heal him.
One, your child seems distant, preoccupied.
This whole uptight thing?
From carrying on in your overly exuberant Latina ways.
Away. - right, well, I appreciate it very much.
Something amazing has happened!
Always do. That's what is want to hear.
I've had cramps I miss more. Shoot him on sight.
And when all the ideas start coming just write down.
The thought that.
And the thought of living without each other,
I'm getting shaky thinking about it.
I am so jazzed about this event with the president next week.
I'm just so happy that I don't have herpes.
I just - I always think, like, they're gonna say no cause I've had such bad luck.
To think of not seeing your face every day.
The thought of not being with you.
The thought of not being with you
I shudder at the thought of separating from you!
That there was someone out there like me,
You know as I think about the goodness of Jesus.
The thought of riding in a car makes me want to puke.
At the thought of the paradise
No sooner said than done. Bare - headed as we were.
That Ashley's not coming back,
Thinking about the Atlantis series, l'd like to do more research.
Faced with my own mortality, I might rather be elsewhere.
If I think of anything else, I will be sure to let you know.
Knowing that from now on, you'll do what I say when I say it,
I'm so excited for the party tonight.
I'm really fired up for the show tonight.
The idea that this is the person I'm gonna be from now on.
And the thought of the two of them in bed, and inevitably full of intensity, caused her some conflict.
Consider in what they serve, why the hell do I care?
I can't stand to think of them out there in the shit with out me.
But I can't stand thinking about her like that.
To think he might spend his life alone... Quite, quite.
And the idea that he would grow into a powerful animal or dangerous animal
When I think about whatmight happen to him, I.
The thought of him lying in some ditch.
It makes me sad to think he's gonna be in prison
Considering what he did to you,
My nipples are getting hard just thinking about him.
When I thought about him and it confused me.
It is so on the surface scary when you think about who he is and where he comes from.
I don't want him to go into another rose ceremony
Thinking of his death makes me,
Thinking about him whining all the time bitching and moaning:
I just couldn't bear the thought of a world without him in it.
The thought of him having a life with another woman.
Makes me sick to think we weren't there when he died.
Just the thought of him trying something with her makes me
Knowing everything that he was working so hard to build
I hate to think of him being unhappy.
I get so angry to even think that that guy's alive.
Considering everything that's happened.
It'd be cool to know who else might have died on this cord.
And when I think about losing you,
The thought of losing her
I can't stand to think there wil be some little kid out there
The thought of losing Serena forever.
Thinking about them plastered all over the Internet.
And I've just been feeling like crap thinking that .
And the thought of you two together
The thought of you two living together it's not like that.
The thought of you two living together... It's not like that.
The thought of you two living together.
It makes me so miserable and envious to think you have seen the sea and your poor old aunt has not!
I shudder to think what the redheads get.
And the thought of losing all that money.
The thought of you living here and having our baby here
The thought of your hand back inside me.
The idea of letting you go.
And I got defensive because I thought, what if she's right?
When I imagine you with your wife.
I don't like the idea of you making love with her.
I don't like the idea of you going off island - hopping with her. It's romantic!
If I think of you and the boys.
Lf l think of you and the boys.
The thought of you with my daughter.
The thought of you at home nice and warm, keeps us good.
Ever think that maybe you're lonely
Wanted to kill you for everything you did to me.
And it excites me to death
It pained me to think about your future.
Rejoice at the thought of you
The thought of you... it is gives me hope.
It's so weird thinking that you hated me.
Didn't care if he was caught as long as you were dead.
It's been hard for me thinking you died,
Oh, I shudder to think what you charge
Picturing you looking at the mirror it would scare the shit out of me.
I cannot help but feel that you are madat me.
And to think these little fingers have been.
The thought of you with your big floppy cock
They'll sing to win at nationals
It just makes me sick that your parents are never gonna know that you wrote that story.
To feel your body stuck to mine
I think about what would have happened had you not been there.
I just got really wound up at the thought of you getting checked out by some creep.
I like the thought of you being surrounded by a protection detail.
The thought of you being trapped on that ship,
I can't stand the thought of you getting locked up over me.
Just the idea of you going anywhere with someone
And the thought of you marrying some other guy is.
I was thinking about what you were gonna do to me.
When I thought of you coming all alone,
Thinking of you with someone else just drove me crazy.
You really worry me considering how young you are.
Since it took you this long,
Every time I thought about what you said, I started crying.
If I imagine closing the caravan door, I feel better.
And that it kills me to think about ever.
To think that within a few hours
When l think about it!
The thought of somebody else, you know, holding his hand.
I cannot help but get tense when I think that these will be used in battle.
Oh, I can't get California out of my mind. I know.
The idea that doctors and relatives get to start weighing the quality of a given life
The thought of lunch leaves me numb
It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days,
I mean to think that.
I can't concentrate. The thought of my impending incarceration.
The thought of another embassy tea paralyzed me.
The thought of losing you, too.
And it's an absolute tragedy to think of what's happened and how quickly.
It made me happy to think that I'd see you again
The thought of beating you in court is just too hard for me to resist.
The idea of not having you
The thought of never seeing her again， Clark.
Were you getting all misty just thinking of losing me?
Then I suppose he had it, which really steams me.
The thought of spending time with you.
That got to where I am by sleeping with Catherine.
To think I only got two days with the love of my life.
I'm just mad we have to be with those dogs!
And to think your genes will be in our grandchild.
When I think about the way we grew up.
It's nice to think my father might have had something to do
You know I am really scared to go back.
The thought that I'll be here when he gets home helps him through it.
I'm just so excited about the sanctuary.
I can't even think when I'm around her.
Considering how people in this neighborhood feel about me.
Get your mind out of the bedroom.
When you think of garbage, think of akeem.
I can't sleep well knowing he's pulling my strings.
I can't stand the thought of losing my little treasures.
Divas make me want to puke.
The thought of her out here by herself.
Nerve - wracking the idea she might make the wrong choice of husband.
I felt more relaxed
The thought of having them watch me
The thought of her in prison is.
The thought of her with somebody else is making me sick.
The thought of her dating that thievish entitled do well,
And I just would dread the thought that she's a heartbeat away from the presidency.
I can't pretend someone doesn't make my skin crawl.
Just thinking of her I get thirsty.
I thought of her out of there by herself.
To think about her now with someone else,
The idea of her out there, alone.
And thinking how she looked like.
To think of her married to an ordinary gentleman from Kent.
To imagine her humping that pervert makes me sick to my stomach,
To think if you hadn't been there what that terrible man might have done.
Keep thinking if I'd just taken the time to ask a few more questions been more observant me.
The notion that anybody could take me away from them.
My heart grows heavy
When they think of Wisconsin? Come on.
And I think about all the crying and spitting up .
It always makes me sad
I think about it, I get like hives.
What I wouldn't give to see the look on the general's face.
The thought of somebody else,
My heart flutters
I just can't stand to think of that
That makes me so sad.
And that scared me.
It just simply boggles the mind.
Queasy just thinking about it, boss.
I'm feeling nauseous from memories of wedgies and swirlies!
I get quite excited by the prospect of the annual bring and buy sale.
This whole idea of a young woman
I cannot think of Frank Churchill
Thinking of flint, it were has done me.
Even the coffee smells better knowing
Just think of all the rich people out there with cancer and tumors.
It is amazing to think that
And the idea that you sitting up there in that chair,
It's strange to think I used to be one of those girls
The thought that we're in the same room
I hated the thought of our last family meal
The thought of losing her.
I'm excited about doing it ourselves.
Knowing what we did.
And to think that after everything we went through,
The thought of us
Thought we left Miami
The very thought of our repatriation is.
It agitates me to pain that the skyline over there is ever our limit.
The thought of us possibly meeting,
To imagine that I would feel the pain
I can't even begin to explain to you how much I am gonna miss you.
I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you.
It's kinda weird to think
I think of getting her
It drove me crazy to think my son would grow up a stranger.
The idea of me naked
To think that he might have been killed here my poor brother.
And the idea that I could have
It's hard to work up an appetite, wondering whether or not I have a job.
Anything I can imagine finding in there I'm scared of.
Yeah, just the thought of my daughter out there in this movie,
Hate to think I put a target on her.
When I seen what I did to that kid down at the store.
You know I'm getting shaky thinking about it.
Cause that image makes me hungry.
And to think that l fucked that up
When I think about how we came to America!
What hurts is knowing how badly I treated that poor girl.
And to think I'd taken the house keys!
Just thinking about how much you owe me for saving your life.
Which is kind of daunting because I sleep in the nude.
The thought of my fiance's touch sickens me
When I think that I might have prevented it!
It's hard to have a good time knowing my parents might be worried.
It's horrible to think how much of my life
It would be nice to think me son were happy then.
To think you couId come to a pIace Iike this.
To think that my wife whom I trusted and proud of,
When I think of my child brought up like that.
I'm totally freaked that the teeniest procedure I perform, I'm gonna kill someone.
And the thought of my life with out you.
And the thought that my legacy has come to this
Thinking that I really lost you made me regret every horrible thing I've ever said to you.
The whole idea of sleeping in a dead girl's room
I can't Iive knowing all the pain I've caused everyone.
And to think that I could make something that could.
Just imagining my life as a member
It's just scary thinking that I might see him again.
The thought of bringing you back to that hellhole, to a place where you could get killed
The thought that my semen mixed with bin laden's.
I think I pitched myself off the astronomy tab
And the idea of another 10 years of it
When I think of the scenarios I could have thought up, I'd kick myself.
Just can't stand to think of all those patients
You got a beef come meet with the chief.
To dispense with any thought of a Regency.
The mere idea of seeing you for the holidays
In one second I'm thinking life sentence,
Funny to think one will be in the thick of it tomorrow.
and I can't help laughing myself at your surprise
And to think that that little girl has grown into the one woman
I'm just happy when I think of Thursdays when you come see me.
The thought of a child without legitimacy in the palace of Naples.
I mean the idea of something bigger than me, a God,
The thought about anybody seeing those tapes,
When I think of peopIe going hungry it breaks my heart.
Feel a bit funny about it, you know, since.
I'm sick of everything always being about you.
I'm scared that it's hereditary.
The fact that everybody can hear me puking.
And I was thinking about how when I see you or I hear your voice on the phone.
I can't stand to think about eternity,
I can't bear the thought of it going to a homeless person.
When I think of warmth then I'll think of you
It's scary to think that your life can end
It's amazing when you start thinking about babies.
The thought of Gaius' hands upon me.
Thinking about seeing him.
How thrilling it must be to go bankrupt.
It's sad to have the thought of leaving.
Words fail me when I contemplate the bald eagle.
Just the idea of standing around that hospital room watching you die,
Just the thought of somebody doing that to Alison is really
Considering the first record
To behold Solonius's face when he sees me
I just feel safer knowing he's around.
What comfortable word is wholly yet
It's almost as though the thought of marriage
I nearly gave the tapes back,
The thought of marriage turns my stomach.
I feel, if I can fly free of it, that pleases me.
The thought of walking free from this
The idea that we had been
If I thought I was going to end up like miss Bates,
Thought they were gonna lose!
Tonight I write the saddest lines.
And to have the idea that you're going to go out,
It upsets me a little bit to think that art should be allowed to make statements.
The idea that Irene was murdered by a shadowy kingpin
Thinking of Emily, I often wondered about my own mother
It chills me to think what Morgause has planned for Arthur.
Son of a wealthy man who nearly passes out at the thought of blood,
The idea of being touched
As long as it's on the cuff and not on my back.
Scares me to death to be put to sleep.
There's something nice about the thought of being rocked to sleep in water.
The thought of losing two daughters at once,
The idea of just getting up there, I get all pale and sweaty.
The thought of having to bury your own son.
The whole idea of paying for a ride
The thought of hurting you fills me with profound sorrow.
I'm a heartbeat away from becoming first wife
You get queasy when it comes time to finish, is that it?
And then it nearly killed me to add in all those grammatical errors.
Still gags at the thought of kissing her, then be my guest,
It makes me laugh imagining kissing you.
I am repulsed by the idea of making the sex with a woman.
The thought of going back to that house.
I can't stand the thought of raising a child on that ship.
The idea of losing him, too.
Tore him up thinking she was gonna raise their little girl.
The thought of being a father.
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth
The thought of staying at a hotel near the runway unnerved me.
And think of what you have to endure.
I hate to think OS you and your wise up here alone,
And the thought of her being thrown
And the thought of giving him that last part of me.
The truth was the thought of holding him terrified her,
The thought of clasping your greasy hands
The idea of just getting up there.
For real forever, and I'm just.
Just the thought of sticking
As I thought about Ieaving the apartment that I had Iived in for the past decade.
And I just hate the thought
The thought of leaving you breaks my heart
I get a bad feeling everytime when going to meet ‘that person'.
The idea of a bank being the guardian... Stop this nonsense, Jim.
It's tough to get used to the idea of retiring.
The thought of sending him away to fight.
The idea of reliving her death.
The idea of facing an empty apartment
Who stands to win from all of this?
I'm real excited, I love doing runway,
You hate having to wait and come back and try again.
Kind of sad when you think about it.
And in that thought, all my guilt flies away.
I think of the horror that has been inflicted on this 15 year old girl,
That's quite an incredible tradition when you come?
I really resent it!
I get horny just thinking about it.
Shiver just to think of it.
I'm all chicken skin just think about it.
Though it does kill me to imagine
So, with that and the open bar in mind,
The thought of what ingredients might constitute this filth repulses me.
This thing goes to a man's head.
To think it almost happened to me really bothers me.
I get white knuckles thinking about what might be ahead for those folks.
The thought of all that weed down there in the sewer,
It's unbearable for me to even contemplate.
The very thought makes me tremble.
I get goose pimples just thinking about it.
It pisses me off when I think of that asshole.
I'm tired of letting this thing play with my head.
To think after all these months you were here by yourself it just breaks my heart.
The thought of what ingredients
Uh, you know it's funny to me when I think about it.
Just to think that this is the last day.
It's crazy to think that you know
The heart constricts at the thought.
I'm swelling up just thinking about it.
I get sad just thinking of it.
Think of it as a glorified sparring session. Here's something you'll like.
I'm mortified that this outrage happened on U.S.
I tremble just thinking about this trip.
You know that's when it hits you, that.
To think that I might suddenly.
The more I think about this the more it concerns me.
The very thought of discovery.
The thought of that fucking Syrian
The thought of that monster crushing her.
And when I think of that delightful old gentleman.
I shudder just thinking about it.
And with that mental picture,
The thought of that fucking Syrian shoving his devious cock inside her.
It's astounding to think that this horror happens
It's scary to think so much is out of one's control.
I find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board.
Oh, my heart starts pounding just thinking about it.
Think of all those unfortunate souls living in the hell of the trenches,
The thought of that whole part of our life driving away.
It's just all the details are stressing me out.
The idea of famous Hollywood people wearing a button -
That's the part I can't stand.
I still shiver when I think back on those cold winter nights.
Knowing that phantom was living my life with Lana for over a month
It fucking kills me to think he's being punished for the shit I done.
Uhh the thought churns the stomach.
It pisses me off that any guy can touch this beautiful thing.
I can't face the thought of food.
Just thinking about her makes my toes tingle.
Thought it was you.
If you think you're dead.
You figure out pretty quickly where the other kids go.
So you knew we were gonna go somewhere into combat.
Imagine the gossip if he saw you.
Would you like some more whiskey? - yes, please.
The thought of it just killing me.
It makes me cringe to think people would be walking on eggshells, treating me all nice.
When I think of his parents, I'm a bit scared
When I remembered you I went to the mansion.
My tits are aching for you.
The thought of going back to that house.
I'm mad just thinking.
Just thinking about her gives me a hard - on, like now.
The hideousness of that foot will haunt my dreams forever.
When we remember Qu yuan
It breaks my heart to think
It breaks my heart to think of our hopeless love.
Thinking about our first kiss stiII makes my heart flutter.
I can't eat it thinking of my family
And to think my little girl.
It just makes me see red all over again.
I can barely keep my legs together at the mere thought of it.
I get hard just thinking about it.
And it kind of makes the food come up in my gullet.
I was peeved just thinking about it.
I'm still completely mind - boled by the fact that
I think about it and start crying.
To think of the years I spent in the gulag,
You guys excited about going to London?
And whenever she wondered, there was a story she always remembered,
I am very excited about this date. We're going to Hunan balcony.
I live in torture thinking of these moments.
And the thought of that girl.
Brings a tear to my eye when I think of that little guy.
And acting unilaterally.
For your family that they'll leave you?
For your family that they'll leave you? Because they will.
Hell - bent on doing nothing that might challenge their audience.
I have a cold. You look pretty sick.
Sensing danger, the mother rat races home.
How do you feel? - fine, thanks.
When you panic you make mistakes.
So take it easy. wait.
Two quick equals one slow.
Episodes season 02 episode 03
The same forever.
A rut? You just started dating.
Following instructions? Where's the creativity in that?
Miss rigid.
Rigid!
There's nothing wrong with being predictable.
Our rut? We just started dating.
I get bored when I stay still.
It's the way people try not
Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, Watson.
The forever cheese.
The way it's always gonna be.
The same conversation, every time.
Always the protector.
Stay all your life, do the same thing?
I go where life takes me but some days it makes me
Naturally with a fixed salary,
And long - distance love affairs that never go anywhere
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Always the same. Fish or souffl? Day after day.
Ten percent. fifty percent.
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.
15, for my children's sake. You don't have any children.
Like ten percent?
He is an adult male.
Ten percent is completely out of the question.
Ten per cent of whatever I recover.
I'm 42, but it doesn't show. - I'm 35.
Me? - did you have other men?
I'm not gonna get hurt. I'm not gonna back off.
I'm not telling. - someone I know?
I'm not particularly nervous. - all the better.
I don't feel the same way as Johan. - how do you feel?
I won't do thing to harm her. Oh, come, come, hogbrain.
First, I am not a coolie.
That wasn't what I meant. - then what did you mean?
One. I don't know!
I don't know the code.
I don't have it, please.
I don't know how to get over this. - Oh, darling.

Lose, and be losers.
And when it couldn't have him, it turned its gaze to the other child.
You slip up, there's nothing there to save you. You're done.

Once Igoe is inside and takes command of their pod.

I don't know once the bit's between her teeth.
Once she snaps out of it,
And once she's gone.
So when she's not around or gets busy,
And once she's eliminated as a person of interest.
She's not like that once she gets to know you.
Once she understood the mood I was going for,
There is nothing to say she won't become a good mother to them
As soon as she's out of the vehicle, she becomes that much more vulnerable.
And they'd come into your beautiful home,
The moment you give them their power back,
Once they start drinking, we all do.
Once these girls start erasing.
And when they start to wake up,
When they're in agreement,
As soon as they realize that you'll love them no matter what they do,
Once they get their claws in, you're hooked for life.
But once they see the flowers and the food,
Once they've crossed, there is one less trafficking victim in Bosnia.
Once they're in the kitchen, isn't nothing left to do but give them a key to your house.
By the time I get my hands on the lost souls,
I'm probably going to miss feeling that once the girls are gone.
So right as they woke up,
Once she does, the program converts the details
As soon as she buys you out, she kicks you out.
Whatever she decides, she can do.
Once she decided she wanted to do something, there was no stopping her.
Once she walks out, we can pick her up.
Once she shows up, you'll meet her and give her the money.
Once she reaches the triangle, we stop no exceptions.
Once she testifies, you're gonna spend
As soon as she finds that out,
As soon as she finds that out, things are never
As soon as she finds that out, things are never gonna be the same.
If she figures out what you've been doing
Once she finds out about you, she'll be drinking again.
The minute that she finds out how you got this information,
If she finds out what the Russians have done,
And once she sees I'm the good guy,
And the second she finds out about it,
If she goes public with that story,
All she need to hear was the sound of your voice.
And then when she was finished or the bad things were over
Once she does.
No sooner does she tell you who you are,
And once she kisses you,
If she hooks up with the Russians, there will be no way for me to save the program.
Once she and her sister run out of thesickle cell meds we gave them,
Once she does, will the property be mine again?
And the benefits run out in November when she turns 18.
Whenever she stays out there too long
As soon as she gets a little stronger,
Once she learns the ropes, takes us legit.
You'd be surprised how those small ones
Once she'd stay put,
Once she finds a place we are all going.
And once she does, I don't think she'll be getting too serious about him.
But once she does.
Once you've had a blowjob, you'd understand.
I leave when I know she's okay.
Once she makes her offer, you sweep in and make your arrest.
And the moment she starts hinting around for a commitment,
She starts poking around her mother's murder, they'll come after her again.
Once she started taking on the attributes of wonder woman,
Once she's got what she came for, she'll piss off again.
And when she gets what she wants, she'll get rid of you.
As soon as she regains her strength, I will leave with her.
Ah, soon as she's fit,
And once she's stabilized we'll take her to the I C U.,
I'm sure he'll tell us as soon as she's stable enough to return to surgery.
And once she tries to leave Storybrooke, well.
And once she gets an idea in her head.
Once she remembers who we were to each other the life we had together.
Once she became aware of the connection between them,
As soon as she realizes what a pain in the ass a baby is,
As soon as she feels it is safe
Once she becomes a geisha, she 'II need many a eimono.
Because the minute she became a liability, you got rid of her
Not since she put that ring on her finger and said "yes".
One call to the cops and you're looking at 25 to life.
And once that happens, we subpoena you,
They'll be ready to extract her
The minute she takes her hand off that car,
If she went to the police, you would need a cover story
And when she does, you will cease to be useful.
Look, once she gets that warrant, I can't stop her,
Except once she had her money,
As soon as she gets the crystal back,
Once she's retrieved the module .
Once she takes that life back!
And as soon as she accepts her new role, her fate is sealed.
And when she's close, I grab her.
And if she starts behaving differently.
She's still gonna kill herself
After she understood the mood I was going for, it was better, much better.
Soon as she figures out that I'm not her new toy, we'll be fine.
She trade me in the second she got something better
Once she had evidence against the fund,
And if she makes the slightest move, then we right!
Once she'd killed her baby, she took off herself.
Once she's here,
And if it comes in contact with this， Yes, it blows up.
Once she feasts her eyes on Texas, it's all over.

Once she's dead and you're on wife number two,
And once she was dead, why stick around?
As soon as she dies, I'm gonna become a civil engineer.
Once she snaps out of it, where does that leave us?
If her father ever found out,
As soon as her father lets her down,
Would all this go away once she delivered?
Once she's in, she will send a message to earth.
But once her lawyer seizes your baseball card collection,
Once her heart stopped beating,
Once her heart stopped beating, there should have been hardly any blood flow
One she'll miss once the novelty wears off,
I 'll probably find out more once I get her diary translated.
When she gets you in her sights
As soon as you can get her blood pressure under control?
That they get caught up in
But once there's one in her sights, that's pretty much it.
And I think once she gets a look at these.
Once she gets to the underpants, they're a deal breaker.
If she sees the police, she'll set it off.
Love will kick you up the arse as soon as look at you.
Once she sees you, she's gonna realize that you tricked her,
She sees you, it's over.
Once she's got them,
And when she sees it's you calling,
Who, at the sight of her will recover much, much faster, won't she?
But once she sees dead Americans
And if she did know you, I think she'd really like you.
Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tell in her.
Inform me as soon as she touches ground!
Once she sees who you are
Once she sees who you are

Once she's stable, we will do this properly.
Once she's on the stand we start to lift the veil
Once she signs the papers... I know.

Once I get her to trust me, I might need you to talk to her.
Once, she was able to love.
Once she's out of danger,
Once she figures out she hates us.
And once it is given.
Once she's in the system, she'll never get out again.
She almost certainly will when she returns to her village,
At a time when marrying the prince of France or the king of Spain.
You can't delay laboronce it starts.
Once she asks me not to throw this wedding,
If she ever remembers me, her mind will burn and she will die.
Because if she wins, she's gonna own me. My advice?
When she passes away, you're on your own.
As soon as she's 50 yards outside of the complex and
Once she turns that corner, she steps off the grid.

It's all about saving lives. It's got to be done.
This was all about a cover up?
It's all about creating equity.
To save his life.
And it's all to set you free.
All for trying to save people's lives.
This is about what's best for the magazine.
Survival's what it's all about.
And it's all to be near Esmerelda.
It's all about winning.
All in the hope that Mrs. Nitta adopts pumpkin instead of you.
All in the hope that Mrs. Nitta adopts pumpkin instead of you
In order to bring out your love for each other.
They only shouted so as to enjoy the beer all the more.
It's all about respect bro.
All for love of Danae. No!
Is that what this is about?
That's what this is about.
Everything led me to this moment.
It has everything to do with that boy.
This is all about the money, my man.
This is all for you.
It's all for us.
Everything's about the tests.
It's not true that everything is learned.
Everything was just screwing, screwing, screwing, and then cut to a money shot.
Everything was planned ahead?
The whole thing is a setup.
Everything was scripted down to the minute
It's all about human choices.
Everything's what?
It all started when he was in a concentration camp.
It began with the feeding.
It all started with cheese.
Everything's been going on since I was 12.
It all started when we caught wind of an obit.
It all began back when I was 17.
It all started when my mom went to work at Max's video store.
Everything starts with a story book.
Everything starts as "just friends"， but the next thing you know.
It started with a chair.
It all started here at take off.
Started off in the navy.
So it all starts in the cell. The cell is a protein - producing machine.
It started when Ashley got involved
It all started with a lie.
And say here, this place is where it all began.
It all began right here， a hundred years ago.
I planned all this from the word go.
Well. It all began right here. On this spot.
And everything started from then
That's where this all got started.
And they're the ones that framed you.
He did this.
This is all just to get to him.
All of it is his idea.
Everything was his idea.
It is his. He owns it!
Everything is his doing.
It's all in his imagination?
He planned the whole thing.
He planned it.
He's plotted everything.
It's up to him, isn't it?
And he did it with malice and premeditation.
You planned this whole thing.
You did everything.
It's always about you.
It's all about you, it's always about you!
You did say yes to everything, and unfortunately,
There was only manipulation.
That you were on top of everything,
You set all this up just so you could get me in bed.
You're behind this!
You brought this on them
You caused this. Your play, your words.
And you're just making all of this up,
It's all your fault
You taught her everything.
And all.You know?
You're misrepresenting everything.
You are making this up. No, I'm not.
Everything is for you.
Everything's your.
You're running the show, aren't you?
It's all your blessings, whether smiles or tears.
It's all up to you.
Whatever happens to them is all on you.
Everything is your choice.
Everything's your fault.
It's all your fault, motherfucker.
This is all your fault. You chased her away!
You happened, Grayson.
Everything is a conspiracy theory with you! Quiet! I can't think!
Everything is the way you left it. I haven't touched a thing.
You did all this
You were behind this?
All this is you. It's you, Jack.
Like you make up everything.
You just made that up. Yes, I did.
That you made it all up. That's fucking great.
You brought this on yourself.
You did this to yourself, Michael.
You did this to yourself.
You'll have to explain to your kid.
Did you make this whole goddamn thing up?
It's your plan. All I did was get you the man.
You had all this planned already.
The decisions were yours.
You put us through all this?
It was all just pretend.
It's gonna be worth it.
When I am his queen and give him a son.
It was all fake.
None of this was real?
Nothing's real
There's nothing real about it. They're programmed.
It's all a fraud! A lie!
Everything is an illusion.
It's all fake
It's a sham fuelled only by the memory of former glories.
Everything is image.
Everything is image, image is everything
I was carried there by the current.
Everything was on the house.
It's all so new and you're adjusting to so much
It's new and it's modern and it's American.
It's all very professional.
All others are fair game.
All's fair. Right?
Well, in all fairness, you had a running start.
It was all on the square.
Everything is about power for you.
Everything is about your career, your job, your hair.
It's about finding people.
It's about the souls.
It's about what a man will do for love.
It's all about lines.
It's all about this.
It's like everything.
Everything is someone else's fault.
It was written.
The universe has been conspiring,
Well, it was allquite impulsive, really.
It starts with a seed of anger.
Totally anonymous.
And all sold to the highest bidder he.
Everything is part of the atomization because it's been taken over by the Nazis.
How it used to be.
It's the same old story. The rich get richer,
Nothing that hasn't been blessed. Nothing too spicy.
That it was all a lie.
Everything is excusable.
One at a time each variable must be solved.
Everything is quantifiable.
Everything is possible，is done in the name of love and solicitude.
Is nothing done but legal.
That's the drugs talking.
Destiny is just destiny.
Somehow we're meant to be together
This is what's in store for me. - you know that's not true.
All are architects of fate
It's always about you.
This is all because of you, Napplebee.
This is about you and me sleeping together.
This is all because of you. Because of me?
All because you couldn't come out from under the covers.
All because of your foolishness
Because of your expert opinion.
This is all about your ego.
And everything to do with your genetics.
And all because of her.
That's what did it.
And that's all because of me.
All because I slept with her five years ago.
Everything changed for all of us.
All this is because of me. I'm sorry.
It's all my mom's for leaving us.
All because my best friend couldn't stand me being so happy.
All this started because my friend Maurice came by my house.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
It's all about color.
That's what this is about? A drug?
That's all due to this trauma.
You're what all this is about, aren't you? What are you?
I brought it on myself.
It just jacked everything up.
That's all there is to it! You've betrayed me!
That's how this all started, isn't it?
This started because of a gig in this shithole.
That universe is revolving around us,
Anything the king or his lawyers decide it to be.
That it was a set up. That I'm totally innocent.
And he has a plan for us after all.
It all started when I first heard the rumors and whispers "around campus about a secret society who called themselves" king and shadows.
Everything went as you planned.
It's where it all begins.
Everything's a movie.
Everything is role - play， Remember?
Everything was handled over the phone.
This is where it all happened.
This is where it happens.
And everything's already broken. I spend my weekends fixing things.
Up until that point was trash?
Everything's physical. Yes. We are physical beings.
Everything is complicated, badly developed and poorly written.
All which are brain activity.
It's all just a choice.
That's up to the man in the sky. I'm talking to her.
It becomes frustration, you know it is devastation.
She's making Anna do all this
Yeah. She lied about the whole thing.
She taught me everything I know.
It was her idea.
Everything is her fault!
Everything's good. It's good. He's good.
Everything is good guys this bad guys that.
Everything just was so hard.
Life was going flow in usual layout.
All the old familiar places.
Everything is so twirly.
Everything was beautiful.
Things'll be great when you 're...
Everything is as it must be at this moment.
Everything is part of the buffet of the universe.
Everything's set.
It's all arranged, isn't it?
Everything is perfect.
For when the baby came. That's all.
It was all very logical.
Everything looks good to me.
Look, take it up with the joker. He killed your woman.
Everything belongs to the group. But we're hungry.
Everything is new and it's clean.
Everything for your career, no time for anything else,
Like this job was forced on you. Nate, I get it, okay?
Everything was gigantic.
All this is in your head.
Fact isn't what you see
All of it is overwhelmingly beautiful.
Everything went in that direction. I know.
All good from where I'm sitting.
All in vain
There's nothing anyone can do.
How would anything begin?
How did it all begin?
We're all related.
It's all connected, isn't it?
It's all your boons， whether smiles or tears
What happened was an accident!
It was an accident. Okay.
It's all a trick. It's an illusion.
It was Ashur!
It's everything I ever wanted.
I'm sorry for everything it's my fault.
Sorry for everything. Okay.
You know it was aII my fault.
You know it was all my fault
Instead, we did everything.
Are we responsible for this, or the ones who caused us to come here?
I did them all!
I did all that, so what are you going to do?
I did that. I hooked you up with everybody.
My mother just decideseverything, you know?
I arranged everything.
All of this is because of me.
L caused all this, right?
And this is what I saw.
All on my own.
I owe you everything.
Everything in mine.
All of it, Kevin!
All of this it's my fault.
It was all my fault
That I'm making all of this up?
It's all my fault. - what's your fault?
Everything was my fault. Well...
It was a stupid mistake. When I lost my son,
I'm sorry about everything. I just want to talk
What happened in new York was all my fault. I didn't read the signs.
It's all mine. Until the end of days.
Everything was my idea.
I made the whole thing up.
No, I did that all by myself.
That I forced myungsin to do everything.
I got to be the boss.
I made this mess, now I'm gonna clean it up.
I forced you to do all that. No. You did not.
If not for rent.
Everything is exactly the way it was meant to be.
Everything went according to plan,
That's the way she's gonna be treated.
That everything is free will
Everything's gotta be a fucking challenge for you.
Everything's been a setup coming from way up top.
It was all politics, to get back at me.
All are politics, all
It's all politics. I think you'll understand.
Everything was open and now,
All things are a number.
It's all in the math.
Everything is a definite number,
It's all new.
We didn't purposefully start this.
Everything was determined by Japanese army.
It's about moments, man. That's all that.
Everything was temporary.
The best of everything.
Things worked out all right in the end.
We're all bound by a legal statute.
They're alive.
There was everything under the sun.
We're in the master, babe.
Everything's risk.
It's all my fault
Everything else is who knows?
Everything was up in the air.
Everything's just unknown, so it's really hard to deal with,
Everything is as it is,
And everything's the way it should be,
Everything's mechanized and standardized.
Everything is copasetic.
Everything seems hazy I'm a wild one
Everything works fine.
It's all decent business.
Normally distributed, but an implication
Everything's a weapon. Everybody's an enemy.
Something was falling into place.
There's no there, you know?
And all are Bolingbroke's.
I'm where I'm supposed to be. I was wrong，You're the right guy.
Everything happened as it should.
Everything is a test.
It's all a game.
And it all comes out of mine.
All is gray!
I'm following Clark's orders.
That everything's separate.
Everything's a joke and everything's a test.
It's all here and now.
Everything was status quo.
It's all business.
It's always business, especially where the Hardwicks are concerned.
It's all business, that's what you failed to grasp.
Everything's stuck on using iron.
That you were the first ones.
When it comes,
It starts and ends with the Union. Understand? I came to you, right?
Everything is made of energy.
It's all in the eye of the beholder.
Everything just runs directly off the blood.
Everything is right out in the open.
In one another's being mingle why not I with thine?
Everything is connected.
So everything is its mirror image.
It's all relative.
This is as real as it gets.
It's all real and you know
It's all real and you know?
It was real and it was great, and it was really great.
Everything's true.
This is really happening, isn't it? She's leaving.
Everything's real, darling.
It's all real. The beast is here.
All of it was real? My mom's gone?
It's all happening for real, Trent.
It's all just guesswork.
All is fleeting, all will go; What is gone will then be pleasant.
Everything was temporary
Everything is a secret.
All else is vanity.
Everything's a joke. Everyone's a punch line.
It was all lies, wasn't it?
And the picture on my desk of my family is a phony,
Everything's calculated.
Everything would be a Roman church.
I didn't believe in fairy tales,
They all happen because God wills it.
Everything's in its place.
Nothing has changed, that's the problem.
Everything's a test, remember? Nothing is what it seems.
It's all a matter of listening of being ready to take it down
That is a mathematical certainty.
It's all gone to shit. What do you mean?
Is just to be a little spontaneous.
It will happen all by itself as you get older.
Everything happens inside the city itself.
Ferguson organized everything.
I stand as weak.
It's all pretence.
It's all make - believe.
It was all a pretense, an excuse to get you on your own.
Nothing really happened. Yeah.
No, this isn't real.
All was nothingness
And all for nothing.
Nothing's what it seems
Everything would look beautiful on the outside,
Everything is permitted.
It was all an act.
All to convince us that we'd better make a deal.
It's all about the catwalk.
It's all a setup.
It was carefully planned.
It was all a big mistake.
Everything's about how wonderful the family is, with lots of exclamation points.
A recipe for murder.
And it's all a lie.
Everything a lie.
Everything is a lie?
Everything's a lie!
Was everything just a lie?
It's all been a lie, hasn't it?
It was all a lie, huh?
There is no truth! This is
It was all a lie， even his name?
That it's a fallacy.
Everything's built on that! That's all we got, boy. Fucking all.
I'm putting it all behind me, you know?
Just rolls right off your back, doesn't it?
He masterminded everything.
The best that this youngish man's money can buy.
Everything was just so elegant
Everything was perfect just like I always dream it would be.
That's what brung it down on us.
It's all so beautiful.
Everything was just so.
That's how it all starts!
That's how this all started, right?
Everything fits perfectly. They type you are.
Everything was taken care of through an intermediary.
It's all done via computer.
Everything goes through a third party.
Whole thing was arranged online - e-mails. I got 50 grand wired into my account.
It's been amazing.
Everything is so freaking.
Everything matching.
It seemed hopeless and pointless, and then, on November 19, 1863,
Everything is so... white.
That everything's sticking in pretty well.
It's like everything's perfect.
This has been so much fun.
Everything is spectacular.
Everything's so time - consuming.
Everything seems like fun
Everything is just alive.
The stuff dreams are made of
Everything was confused and blurred. I didn't nnow what I was doing.
Everything was special
Everything's so bright, even at night.
And everything is gonna be just fine.
All kinds of weird shit.
And illit and full of fantasy.
And up above it's so fair
Everything shiny and beautiful and grand.
They're so real
And all of a sudden.
All of a sudden, I'm on it. Nice story.
Everything was always easy.
Everything's so wonderful.
Everything is unknown, virgin territory.
I am at peace.
It's very money - oriented, everybody worry about the living,
It's only money.
It's the money.
All are wrong
Nothing goes right... Nothing goes right.
Everything's negative.We obviously missed something.
Everything is a conspiracy theory! I protest.
All of them unfamiliar.
Everything washed fresh, a whole new cycIe.
There was this sort of freezing fog hanging over everything,
That all of this will remain off the record.
Deception is everything.
If it happened.
You order fancy food in advance of your arrival.
Everything is upside down
All are lies!
It's a trick.
It was all a fabrication of quilok.
Everything else the man has grabbed from us.
Everything's in black and white.
That everything will go wrong
It just seems unreal.
And things seem so sharp.
Everything seemed so important,
Everything seems to indicate close - contact gunshot wound.
And every indicator says it can't be done.
It's too late.
It's too late, mom.
But it's too late, my darling.
It was too late. I was already pregnant.
It's over.The sun has set.
Things change, you know.
Everything is out in the open.
Everything's exposed.
All the better.
Everything's better.
Everything's newer and brighter and bluer
Everything's tighter.
It's gonna be okay.
And everything's gonna go back to normal.
It's gonna be okay. All right, come on, let's get undressed, okay?
The whole thing.
You operate within an official structure.
You know its a process
There's a point to everything.
Always possible,
I've got everything down except for the timer.
Everything was a bit weird.
Everything I got people counting on it.
It's all in a good cause. That doesn't make it less embarrassing.
There's always a cost.
Everything has a purpose, Colonel, including the circumstances that brought me here.
You got everything covered，I think we can handle it.
Nothing lasts forever, not even a picture.
Always a possibility.
And anything was possible
All is possible. Everything.
And anything can happen
All the things that could have happened to have made you feel he had changed.
It could have been anything. I'm very upset.
It can happen. That is all I'm saying!
So anything's possible, right?
Mike things are looking up.
It's like you said it would be.
Things have way of changing.
But all things have their time.
Everything was going right on schedule.
Everything remains to be done.
Yes, everything will make sense.
All things in their proper order.
Nothing is disturbed. Perhaps they heard us.
There's a sense of purpose. We're a community.
Since that night,
Something's wrong about all this, Trust me.
Everything was slightly mad,
There's always the threat of everything falling apart.
There's always a first time.
This all makes sense. There were so many signs.
It must be nice having all the answers.
Everything could just cease to exist.
Everything is in order. The same doctor
Only clues.
It's everything. If there was one thing you could pick out you'd try to fix it,
Everything has a hidden meaning.
Everything was going right.
All very positive. Yeah.
Nothing ever changed.
Everything was gonna be fine, it was just going to be this stupid little secret
It's too late.
All in good time.
It just all happened so fast.
It's all happening too soon. You moving in.
It's all happening so fast and it sort of feels like it has nothing to do with me.
Out of the blue.
Having all this happen at once, A marriage, a baby,
Like it came so natural.
Everything is happening so quickly...
How slow all of a sudden.
It got very real very fast and I panicked.
The history of the problem
The same area where all that happened.
It all went down pretty fast, I mean.
It'll all come naturally. Isn't that right, Pullo?
Everything comes from the East.
It all came from the stars, but how?
Who owes everything to some unknown alien scientist
A dumbing down.
Everything checked out. Sounds like you had a pretty tough day.
Yeah, it's over.
They're all labelled in terms of time.
That everything will happen when you want it,
Everything glittered and was golden.
And it will all come true.
Things have been great now
Everything's hunky - dory， because you got me in the sack
Everything was kind of fuzzy.
All a blur of sparkly.
And things were booming along.
We got it going on.
That would be this working.
It was just getting good.
Everything's changing.
Everything comes back normal.
Ready for normalcy. - good.
Things in common, old friends.
Everything's all right， Just calm down. I am calm. I'm calm.
Everything fine?
Is everything all right? This isn't about me, right?
Is everything okay? What? Nothing's wrong.
Everything all right, madam?
Is everything all right, ma'am? What do you want?
Is everything all right, ma'am ?- what do you want?
Is everything okay?
Is everything okay? Oh, my God.
Is everything all right? I think so
And everything's cool, right?
Everything's fine. This is true.
Everything seemed fine.
Everything was fine until her phone rang.
Have they been normal？
Everything all right? Fine.
Well, everything is on track.
Everything's dead, Lincoln.
Everything is dead quiet, it seems almost eerie.
Everything is fucked.
It's totally ruined,
Ruined everything!
It's all been spoiled and wasted,
That's how the whoIe thing got screwed up. I broke the covenant.
You have ruined everything
Totally in ruins!
There is nothing to worry about.
Everything's brighter than it was a week ago.
Everything's much easier than for us.
Everything was so much more amazing than I could've imagined.
It all went faster than planned.
There was no ambiguity!
It all feeIs so random... What we're doing？
It just strikes suddenly， without warning.
It all means so little.
Have gone right back into her hands, don't you think?
Somehow you know when the time is right.
Zat explains everything!
It's never too late.
And the gibes of all
Everything is gone.
Is everything... Gone?
The breeze all
It's all gone now. Everything I ever made.
Everything's gone but the Lise insurance.
This is it, mark.
Everything's going great today.
And everything turned out okay.
Everything's all right
So things are all right?
Everything's all right now. My dearest.
Everything's all right. Just calm down
It will be okay, Anna.
Things are fine now. I ran a test.
Everything will be all right. Trust me.
That everything is okay.
Everything's fine. You need rest.
And everything is okay.
Hey, everything okay?
Everything all right? Did that tremor throw off the system?
Everything cool here, baby? - you remember Seymour.
Is everything okay? Absolutely.
Everything's fine. There's an ambulance on the way already.
Everything's gonna be OK.
It's all good, babe.
Everything's alright! Calm down!
It's all right, little ones.
Everything's alright I'm here
Everything's fine. Thanks.
It is what it is.
It was pretty uneventful.
So we're all good there.
Got you at the end of the day.
well, that's all right
It's okay... Fly first class.
It's all about the variables.
Nothing is ready.
It never happened.
None of it's happening.
It's all still there.
Nothing's changed, huh?
Nothing has changed, has it?
Nothing's been decided yet. The autopsy report
It was all just for nothing!
This doesn't make any sense anymore.
For either of us, did they?
It hasn't changed. Let's go.
So we lost everything? We never had everything.
Everything was all right.
It is not ready.
It hasn't happened.
It didn't all happened. It was all planned, right?
It's always now.
Too many things haven't changed. Like what?
It would never stop.
We had no warning I was doing dishes when I got the call
All are nonsense
It means nothing.
Nothing matters.
Kiss of the bitch.
It's meaningless, she's suffocating.
Nothing has gone according to the goddamn plan!
And nothing is going the way we planned.
Always just stays the same!
But nothing has changed
No change.
Nothing's changing, you know,
Nothing has changed. I'm still a pig, you're still a human vacuum cleaner.
Everything's fine. These things take time.
Everything will be fine. Oatmeal's ready.
Nothing works.
Nothing is working.
Everything isn't so fixed.
And everything would be all right.
Nothing's wrong,
Everything is fine, and everything is completely normal.
It'll all be taken care of.
Everything's all right. You'll be all right.
That nothing's wrong right now?
Things are cool, aren't they, mum?
Is everything okay?
Everything all right in there? don't come in.
Is everything all right, doctor?
I'll check this with the manager. Mr. Murdock.
Everything's fine. I went out with your sister.
That's absolutely no problem.
It's all right,
Everything's fine, all you gotta do is stand up.
Everything is gonna be okay. I know it.
Everything's fine, aunt Josephine.
All right, everything checks out, so let's get you paid.
Now I can't.
It's in his blood.
Well, everything's coming up us, kid.
Everything was dead and not a soul was Ieft in the world.
Like everything else.
That everything's away now
Everything is fading. We're no longer here.
That that's it, it's over?
Everything fell apart. He couldn't write anymore.
When all seems lost, the future unknowable,
Have all passed away.
Everything got all off.
Everything was made clear.
Everything went white.
Everything clear? Perfectly clear.
And it was just as clear as day.
It's been wiped clean.
Things are looking up, Giselle.
All from one...
It all begins with a curse.
It comes in their dreams.
It all started with your $200, let's show him how to gamble.
It aII started on the streets of Detroit,
It was all a little bet we made to see just how gullible you could be.
All of this started when I put this ring on my finger.
It all started with the book. A book?
This all began on the train to Cardiff, appropriately enough,
Everything depends on that code. Did you understand anything?
Is everything satisfactory?
Is everything satisfactory? Everything except the interruption.
Everything looks beautiful. Thanks.
Everything became this big conspiracy.
Everything dies.
Everything was destroyed.
Could end?
It just went up like that,
Everything is nailed in our memory,
And everything gets cleaned away.
Every plan I had vanished.
Everything burns
Everything will be swell then.
I did everything you asked.
Everything was done as it was supposed to be done.
It's all right here, honey.
Everything is on straight ahead. In fact don't tell anyone.
Everything is kept just as Mrs. De winter liked it.
Everything's worked out just as we'd hoped.
Make sure you lock everything up good, all right?
This is done by the book.
All protocol was followed, sir.
It was done by the book until you rewrote it!
Everything is complete as planned.
It's all going to plan. He's half in love with her already.
Everything just went out.
Impregnable to about anything but artillery.
Everything is looking different now.
We're all his
And it's understood
It's all okay. It 'sokay because I turned thirty today.
Water brings on an explosion of life
We have looked through everything.
My name's on everything, right?
I guess it all begins with a scientist.
Everything is done up by cellphone.
And that it's out of his control.
Leader of everything.
Everything is in the hands of the gods.
You're choosing everything.
That was decided by your votes last night.
To even begin to make things up to you.
And it's on your conscience.
It's ours for the taking.
It's all done through our nonprofit corporation.
And do all of it without a corporation
We've taken care of everything? We've just hired a valet and confirmed a caterer.
I'll do everything.
I'm gonna take care of all this. You have nothing to worry about, all right?
And I will make all the arrangements.
I'll do all the work. I got us that building back there.
And that's how this works, okay?
I've got this under control.
My great grand father Sozin happend.
Everything's going digital.
He does everything electronically.
Everything goes to my next of kin. What about you?
Everything is crazy now.
Than the best of humanity.
And everything's pointing to fifth column.
Everything's the same.
Everything would have been fine if you'd just...
Everything worked for me, up until the chapter on your first campaign.
Everything's fairly dire.
It's in God's hands now.
There's a lot riding on this night. Not just for me.
I guess the radish is in your basket now.
You're taking all the chances.
It's up to you now. Here we go. Here we go.
So much depends on this working out.
Well, everything looks good except for one thing.
Makes everything a painting.
It all looks fantastic, man.
Everything looks in order.
All seems very neat and peaceful, doesn't it?
Everything looks delicious.
None of this looks familiar. Are you sure we're going the right way?
It's just the straight from it to certain death.
Everything really will be over.
Everything is getting really scary and really crazy.
This is real, and this is gonna be your new life.
You may find that hard to believe,
Everything's coloured, everything, you know？
Everything comes out.
Everything breaks.
Things fall apart.
Everything's falling apart I've lost my wife, my daughters, my onetime mistress, my son.
This is so messed up.
Everything's all messed up. What's messed up?
Things are wrapping up, so I'm betting it's soon.
It will meet in secret, if your Majesty agrees.
Everything's been orderly, and it's all gone like clockwork.
Hubby's dead, the cubs have been slaughtered,
It all happened real fast.
It sort of turned into a reenactment of the inquisition.
Everything that points to the profile,
Everything's still holding within operational arguments.
Everything on the up-and-up ?
It fits everything but the nosebleed.
Simplifies everything. You get your life back.
If things would've been easier.
Let's just get this over with, Cartman.
Everything is accounted for fairy godmother except for one potion. What?
Everything counts.
But everything is going well.
Everything pretty much sucks.
You know, as awful as all of this is
Everything's going to shit right now, OK?
And it was all a little bit rubbish.
Everything's faliing apart
Things get really bad!
Everything's going to hell, Ernie.
Everything's bad now, I know... - stop talking.
Sort of stretched.
Everything is tested and ready for use.
Nothing is left to chance.
It fits together.
All to be over
It's done.
After everything you've done,
All finished.
And so it ended.
But it's all over now.
He's throwing in the towel.
Issue closed?
It's all over
That's it, man.
The mass has ended. Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
This game over? Game's not over.
Everything is over! Everything is over!
It was done. Less than a minute.
It's over. don't come to my house, don't touch me.
It's all over. Daniel's accepted and handed in his keys
It's over. Why don't you give it a rest?
It's all over, honey.
It's over, baby. You missed. - That's charitable of you.
It's all over, darling. We're going home.
Then it's over. All of this is meaningless.
It's over. You don't understand. They made me do it.
It's over. You're out.
It's all over. What's your name?
All is done now. You can go off and love your husband,
It's over. I'm your only hope.
All are finished, you get what you want
Then it's all over do whatever you want
It's over. Are you crazy?
It's over. You know that, right?
It is done. You are free, my love.
It's over, and you're under arrest.
It's over, brother. It's over. OK.
It's done, senior Garza.
It's over, doc. There's nowhere to go.
It's over, Jim.
It's over I will decide when it's over
It's over，Spence
It's over. Agreed.
Is it over?
So the game's up. The chickens have come home to roost.
It was all over in less than a minute.
It's over. Good.
It's over! - that was easy.
It's over! That was easy.
It's over. She's gonna die.
It's over. She's gone.
It's over. She knows it.
It is over, sister.
It's over, honey.
It's all over. - so that's it? Then we failed?
Case closed. Let's shoot them.
It's over.
It's over. It shortly will be, yeah.
It's over, Gusano. Let Dakota go.
Now that it's over, I don't want to talk about it any more.
It's over, I'm not running anymore.
It's done, and I'm sorry for everything.
It's gone, and I'm coming home.
This is the end. We're all doomed.
It's all over with now. We might as well not even show up to graduation.
We're finished. It's over we're done.
It's so over. And it was wrong.
And that's final. I decide what's final!
It's over. I'm finished.
It's over. - I knew it.
That's over. I signed the divorce papers.
This is over! I'm take her in.
Then it's over. I didn't call the police, but don't push me.
It's over. I'm go home now.
This is it. I'm letting him go.
It's over. I win.
It's over, Dana.
It's over. So if you just...
That's it. Shoot him, robo.
It's over, Tom! Put down your weapon!
It's all over. It's OK. It's over.
It's over. - no.
It's over. Fuck you!
And it's over and then he calls four times in one morning.
It's over, Trevor.
It's over, Marietta. Mandy and I were a terrible mistake， I've come back foryou.
It is all over, momon.
What we do now？ that it's over.
It's over, Percy.
It's over.
It's over, Jean.
They're past, pimenov. It's finished.
Now, it's over and it's been an incredible journey
It's over, Forster.
It's over, Costa, you're under arrest.
End of the line, Millicent.
Party's over, Miro!
Now that it's all over, after this incredible ordeal, what are your feelings?
It's over. It's over.
No way we survive this. Death is coming!
It's over, Eddie.
It's over. Come with me.
Is over, done with and forgotten, okay?
I'm done here. - you're not done here.
It's over, it's over.
It's over... So over.
It's over. And unless you want the whole world to know you run a high - class prostitute ring,
So what are you gonna do when all this is over?
When this is all over, why don't you do it?
When this is over, you're gonna do something for me. - what?
We'll leave this place together when all of this is over.
Once this whole thin is over and done, we're gonna get back there.
I'll tell you when it's over.
Now when this is all over, you need to tell me where you're registered.
It's all over, my princess.
I'll see you when it's all over.
Of what's gonna happen to me when all this comes to an end.
When all this is over, someone's buying the first round.
At the end, I mean.
You can have everything.
Everything has been arranged.
Has everything been explained to you?
Everything's ready for you. Thank you.
It's the undertaking.
It was really nice.
It's so passe.
Couldn't be a lot of words?
It's all connected. Shut up.
We have the chain.
Everything comes out exact.
So everything can start over.
I mean is to go back and start over.
And things can stay the way they are.
And everything goes back to normal.
They say that things will be okay,
Is it as good as we hoped?
Thing that'll work out.
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Everything can wait, we must search.
Everything can stay the same.
Can solve everything.
Which way our hearts will go.
Meant we could always be that open.
Everything else gets shorted.
The whole deck's gonna be reshuffled. Seven, six, five.
You sure that thing's gonna hold you up?
You stayed after all the others deserted.
And everything somehow seems right.
The curtain falls. An iron curtain.
So all this was for nothing.
Kept it inside didn't tell no - one else.
With everything staring down at us,
Those moments where everything sort of comes together.
Everything working?
All factors suggest he has nothing to lose.
Everything about this guy says he was on the up - and - up.
Probably cost him a stripe. So where's the diamonds and the bassinets, huh?
It was bad work all around. I'll take the heat.
Everything points to someone who fled after the shooting.
All of which would suggest that Moriarty may be right.
You look totally in control
Everything was already done by the native people 2,000 years ago
everything hurts so bad
And you messed it all up.
And ruined everything!
You ruined everything.
Everything is squeezed for you
You were right - about everything.
The hillside was like ice cream.
Everything was cold and frozen.
Everything's frozen.
Everything has been taken away. So that really sent me into a tail spin.
She's destroying everything!
It's already decided.
I'm the only one doing any work here.
Everything's shit, dad.
Everything is being twisted into a sort of tunnel shape.
All totally wiped down. Almost like it was...
They've taken everything. - not quite everything.
Everything has been destroyed.
So everything was destroyed?
It changes everything.
It changes everything
Everything was inventoried.
Everything is ruined.
And, in fact everything has been cleaned up and put away.
Everything charred virtually beyond recognition.
Everything's been approved, so we're on.
Everything was restricted, everything was censored.
Everything is backwards now, like out there is the true world
And all in darkness.
By the time you get back.
It all started when.
It started a little over a year ago.
I had to learn everything all over again, you know?
It all starts with the starlight scope,
Everything's going to change now, isn't it?
Because it's always about you.
Does everything have to be about you?
It's important that everything look right.
We relied on it for everything.
Everything had to be confidential.
Everything is classified there
Now just keep it simple. Just like we practice.
And all with the strength of that rose.
Everything has to be moved up
Everything's coming apart.
Everything must be perfect.
It all depends on other people.
Everything is going to change.
Okay, move on, Angela!
The attending takes the lead.
Everyone must obey orders
You'll be doing what the doctors say. Got it?
And I am now calling the shots.
And he wants it by tomorrow night.
Everything's coming to an end.
That everything's perfect for Mr. Debris
Perfection, people.
I want to make sure everything is perfect.
All must hurry. This will all be over in moments.
Everything should just be on the table.
Everything has to be cleaned.
Everything receives a spit and a polish.
She wants fabulous that is her simple request
I want fabulous that is my simple request
And it's thanks to her.
I have to do everything!
I'm trying to do it by myself. I can't just pull up stakes and take off by myself.
I need to do it on my own.
Everything is packed
Everything must to be your way.
Everything was going according to the little girl's plan,
Your informant is making all the rules.
And everything was going to plan.
Everything in its proper box.
All that was going to change.
That's all gonna change.
It's all going to change.
I want only dummy text and up on that wall.
Everything must be fast, loud, noisy
Find out everything about her, and bring her to me tonight.
Everything is fucked up.
Everything washed a whole new cycle.
This is happening according to our way.
It was imperative that everything went according to plan.
We do everything in writing.
Everything depends on what you make of this opportunity.
It wasn't me it was you
Wait until we are in uniform, my boy.
It all ends here.
This has to end.
It was curtains and everybody knew it, but nobody said so.
End of the line, cool breeze.
Everything steamed, organic and germ - free.
Everything needs to be destroyed. Every last bolt.
Everything's got to be perfect for.
Thanks for everything. Pleasure.
Everything in moderation.
It'll all be quick.
This plays out by the book. Not in a back room with a rubber hose.
There are laws.
All hunched up, pretending to be so damned understanding.
It all had to be very discreet
You have to make every move your own.
That's what makes the whole thing work.
It all depends on the heat shield.
It's amazing what you can come to take for normal.
Everything is in its place.
Everything is solved.
Everything's worked out, you're going to the convention.
It's all been sorted out. Back to normal.
Everything's settled. I fixed it.
Everything's fine, dad. We decided not to go.
Well, we got it all worked out, sweetie!
It closes the circle.
It's all for all real.
It's all for real
It's all for real, I'm telling you just how I feel,
It's all in play.
Well, it was all slotting into place
Planning so that I don't brake unnecessarily.
Everything's timed out to perfection.
Everything's been worked out so the image hits the right spot.
Everything's booked. So the really big question is where are we going to stay?
All this gives me a stomachache.
He got everything.
Say everything that's upsetting you.
Whatever comes next.
It's terrifying for me.
And I'm just thrilled about everything.
I ruined everything.
Refreshing.
It was never dull.
It all makes sense.
Everything's set. Where'd she find him?
All the right notes.
All confirming that he is not my son.
It just goes to show - vulgar.
Let's stop all this.
Everything is rational.
And everything is supposed to be perfect.
Everything is supposed to end.
Let's get this thing over with...
All shall be forgotten.
All that's forgotten?
All shall be forgotten? You don't say.
None of this makes any sense. He just hurt his arm, dad.
Makes perfect sense.
I mean it all adds up.
And it appears they worked as a team.
Everything about this place stinks of "government ops".
That's all there is to it.
It all makes sense now.
It all makes so much sense.
Everything's been negotiated.
Thanks for everything.
Everything is totally clear now.
And it was all out in the open?
It all makes sense now, doesn't it?
Being where you supposed to be. You believe in that?
And has somehow made it look like you did it.
Everything looked clear like glass.
It all seems so long ago
Being in the right place.
It all started with the gangs. You know, people tend to forget that.
It started here with a vow to never let this happen again.
It all began with the very first molecule.
It all began Able's garage.
Than you can possibly imagine, because he loves you.
Everything is just super.
Things are finally back to normal.
It could be forever and ever and ever.
This was rock bottom.
Everything is exactly the way it was before.
Everything turned out the way you wanted.
Everything that follows is a result of what you see here.
It was about who you are, what you are, or what you believe in.
It happened just like you said it would.
It's all got to do with the rabbit's foot.
And how this all connects to the mayor.
Everything's been just like usual.
Is everything like usual?
Oh, because it's all about luck.
Everything out here has to be sexualized.
Nothing like I thought it would be.
That's just how I dreamed of it.
Everything's exactly the way I left it.
Everything just like on my funny little map.
It all has to do with Warner Kaminsky.
You're so dramatic.
This has everything to do with the cops.
It's about the money.
It's about food.
It's in the shadows.
The context shifts. Things you thought were luxuries become essential.
Everything's over so quickly
It all goes into the computer and gets sent back to network.
Everything's up to code.
Everything passes on.
All have past
All in the past.
All that's gone now. Can I call you next weekend?
After all that's passed, knowing all you know now.
Is it all over?
Well, it's all working out, huh?
It's gone. What happened to it?
It's all over now. Think about me.
It's over, now we can get on with the rest of our lives.
Passing is passing.
Everything's all right. I'm going to take you home.
All is forgiven, my little ladybug.
That was low, going over my head like that.
It's over. Dad!
So this is over. Finished.
Let it go, Maurice.
It's over, okay?
It's all for the best. All for the best.
There, there.
And now it's over, and we're just friends.
I feel like time will go by and we'll all run into each other
It's already started. This is it.
Just all went by so fast.
And that problem disappears.
Have worked pretty good.
Everything is pretty and perfect.
Everything's perfectly normal.
Everything is still the same.
Until we have gathered the rest.
Everything is so uncertain! Sir William says my life is still in danger.
That's a good thing, right?
Is it too late, darling?
Are you settling all right?
Everything would still be running normally.
Because they live in my memory.
And things would be just like they were? Thanks for making the time.
I don't feel like anything is missing.
It's still a work in progress, but Rome wasn't built in a day.
Everything is still operational. The emergency system is already rerouting power.
Boy, everything looks so good.
Everything all right in here?
Is everything okay? Were you worried about little about me?
Everything is OK? Very well.
Everything okay? It's great, thanks.
Everything's okay, but you gotta stay still. Where's Sam?
Things were going well until she wanted to...
Is everything okay with... - waffles.
Uh, well, everything is okay, but we have no way to leave.
Yeah, it's all right, so long as you keep your head down and do your bird.
Everything all right up there?
To make sure everything was okay.
We okay?
That make everything okay now?
Is everything okay, Giovanni?
Is everything okay, honey?
Is everything okay? Your son?
Everything okay? You been going to your doctor's appointments?
How's everything going? What do you think?
Is everything okay, sir?
Everything go all right, lieutenant?
Is everything okay with... Waffles.
Is everything alright, Mrs Goodfellow?
Everything all right? Uh, not exactly.
Is everything all right? Oh, yes, indeed.
Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry.
Everything all right? Yeah, I'm just doing some thinking.
How did everything go? - great!
Is everything okay? No, I'm fine.
Is everything all right? Angela, I have to go to my brother's for a while.
Everything okay over there, pen?
Everything cool? I'm cool, man.
Is everything fabulous? Yes. I didn't know you were here.
Is everything okay, Dexter?
Is everything okay? We just got a call from the alarm company.
Is everything all right? Did we do something wrong?
Is it all set? Hope so.
Everything okay? - I'm good.
Everything good here? Just fine.
Everything okay? - yeah, these gentlemen were just leaving.
Everything alright? - yeah.
Everything's OK? yes.
Is everything okay? - I'm fine.
Is it going well? Yes.
Is everything okay? Oh, yeah. Everything's good.
Is everything okay here? Yeah, thanks.
Is everything all right? Yes, thank you.
Is everything okay? What's the situation?
Everything come out okay? Splendid. I'm fine.
Is everything okay? It's nothing important.
Is everything okay? It is now.
Everything OK? Can I help?
So, everything worked out OK? - yeah, thank God.
How's everything? Everything's good.
Is everything okay? It's fine.
Is everything okay? Is there anything inside me?
Everything all right down there?
Everything alright?
Hey, is everything all right,
How are... How are things?
I hope everything's OK.
Everything okay? Nothing's okay.
Everything all right, darling? Oh, terrific. I'm just eating.
Is everything okay? He took his first step.
Everything okay? Would you like to talk? About?
Is everything okay? What are you thinking about?
Is everything all right, ma`am，what do you want?
Is everything okay, Clark?
Everything okay? It's really sad with the closure.
Is everything okay? Did something happen?
Is everything okay? What's the matter?
Everything all right, senator?
Everything okay? - Oh, yeah, things are great.
Everything okay?
Everything all right? Yeah, everything's fine.
Oh, is everything okay? Yeah, it's just the usual.
Everything okay, Nightjar? Anything I need to know?
Everything okay, Signora?
Everything okay? - it's great, thanks.
How's things? How are the kids?
So, is everything OK, little girl?
Is everything all right here, Brenda? Yeah.
Is everything all right? - sure.
Is everything okay? Yeah, why?
Is everything all right? I don't know, annik.
Was everything okay? - I lost her for a little bit.
Everything all right? I thought I saw an argument.
Is everything okay? I mean, you're not having any problems, are you?
Everything okay? I don't want to talk to her right now.
Is everything okay? What do you have on Bertrand?
Everything okay? Sorry.
Are things going okay? Yes.
Everything OK? Yeah. I'm just tired.
Is everything okay? Oh, yes, fine.
Everything okay? Yes, it's wonderful here.
Everythingall right here, folks? Great. Thank you.
Everything okay over there ?
Is everything okay, dad? - not bad.
Everything's under control. Everything is just fine.
The wean's all right. That's not the point!
Is everything all right? Yeah, yeah.
Have you had quiet guard?
Everything is fuzzy.
It's just fate.
My parade shall be quite dry under my umbrella!
Everything is just so by the numbers.
We still don't know anything for sure.
It's mysterious.
Seems like everything's going back exactly the way it was.
You are seeing nothing yet.
Well, everything's unpacked.
Near the border of Afghanistan.
All that needs to be done,
Nothing wrong?
Everything seemed okay until Wednesday night.
It's not over.
It's not yet too late.
Nothing's set in stone yet. So, you're not denying it.
This isn't over.
This isn't over, you mark my words.
Things aren't finished, right?
Is everything alright? You scoundrels want me to die.
Is everything to your satisfaction?
Is everything in order? Yes.
Is everything... - right now!
It's all being arranged right now.
Nothing will have settled down, yet.
Well, that's all fine and dandy
Everything okay here?
Are you guys okay?
Yeah, thank you.
Is everything all right, darling?
So, everything's going okay with you.
How's everything going? Yeah, good. You want a seat?
Everything all right? No, it fucking isn't all right.
Everything is so messed up.
It's perfect.
Everything so new and exciting.
Everything is so crisp and clear and beautiful
It's all new and fresh and exciting.
Everything was normal？
Everything is so perfect
Everything's such a mess.
It's just beautiful.
Everything is so beautiful.
Everything's so nice and romantic.
It all slipped away.
Everything's so black.
Everything's so dark.
Everything rests in the graveyard.
All in a better place.
I mean everything was booming, okay?
And everything was going off without a hitch.
And it all worked out quite well
Everything was going great.
It's all falling together perfectly.
This is all working out for the best
This is all happening too fast.
And everything was going great.
Everything was running smoothly, except for one small detail.
And things were progressing, if you know what I mean.
I'm taking my time.
And I was having a real impact until...
You take everything in stride.
Everything is moving so quickly, it will be nice to slow it down.
All going very well actually.
And that's successful,
When everything doth make a gleeful boast?
That's worked really, really well.
And everything is going perfect. We'll see you there?
Everything was going great till the gardener showed up.
Everything's going fine, okay? Stop worrying.
Everything's going just fine.
It isn't over till it's over.
Everything is linked.
It's all coming together.
Is everything okay, dad? Not bad.
She likes she knows everything.
I see everything.
Everything gradually regained normalcy. Only my brother, My son.
Getting near the road again.
Everything was going through.
And everything is terrible.
What we used to call functionalism.
Everything obeys all the laws of physics and logic.
With everything laid out in an orderly fashion?
Everything was so bad.
And all the same things
And this was cloudier.
Everything is so serious.
Everything's so tedious.
None of it made any sense.
It's all so confusing. Who knows?
Everything is strange
And everything's great, but it's only a matter of time
Everything is so good, We're going great.
Everything seems funny, it all looks good.
All the trimmings!
And your life will be perfect.
Everything perfect, everyone happy,
It happened all so slowly.
So fresh and exciting
Everything got done so quickly.
And it's all so dramatic,
And everything just sounds so interesting,
All been very interesting, hasn't it?
It was so romantic.
It was messed up
Everything was so clear.
It's all so boring.
It all feels too familiar
It was all so real.
Everything so far, so far away.
All very authentic.
It's so true and I owe it all to you
Everything's simple. I mean you don't play games.
Everything's just gone so wrong.
None of this is okay.
Every pebble here is filled with magnificence.
It was just so natural.
It's all very cosy.
All have ourselves a real big laugh.
You had such lovely things.
Everything is so good.
It's all obvious.
And everything was bright
It all just feels so arbitrary.
It all worked perfectly until that kiss.
Had been anything but,
Everything is fine.
Everything is full of dust,
All that's been lost.
And it got everything wrong!
With everything going so wrong, you have to wonder,
This is wrong. This is so wrong.
It all began one Tuesday after school.
Everything shines.
And that's when everything changed,
This changes everything.
Let things go their way.
Everything was buried with him.
And... Let go?
Everything is coming up Carlos!
That they'll never be the same.
Nothing can ever escape
Everything was just focused on the future all the time. And now.
Everything will be on the test and the test will be everything.
All things are made anew.
And everything stopped.
Have all passed away
It all happened very publicly.
And it's all down to very innovative stuff, like the fuel tank, which is very shallow and very long,
Everything is perfectly fine.
Oh, it's going... Great!
We're perfect.
Everything is amazing. We deserve high - fives.
It was quiet and oncentrated.
It went perfectly.
Everything is chaos and all gone to hell. How did it get to be Iike this?
Everything is chaos. It's all gone to hell. How did it get to be like this?
It was all very clear.
Everything is very gratifyingly... Okay.
Which would be completely romantic and amazing,
This is so simple.
And things seem to be going great
Everything had gone very very well,
It all rests on him.
But I know that I can depend on you,
It's all riding chickon you, champ.
I'm counting on you. You gotta keep him busy until I can get everyone together.
Everything depends upon you, my dear brother,
You're all I can count on，Thank you.

A straight flush won me a week's worth of his night shifts.
She had this look of awe. She said it's him.
To pull something like this.
Like whoa!
You act like somebody died
One set of hard front wings and a set of soft hind wings, used for flying.
A night - vision binocular
A large dose of potassium chloride can result in a fatal heart attack.
How about a pair of sunglasses?
An occupied vessel but powerless.
Something's off.
When he looks like some big business blowhard -
A really good voice, you know, we blend well.
Seems like a nice mom.
A ll skeleton penetrated by 12 prods.
You have perfect teeth.
Shyly looking away and thrusting your chest out is natural?
It's a little coffin.
A pair of cheap sunglasses is less suspicious
A rainbow colored parasail and it was on my head.
Really good dancers.
A comprehensive picture
All sad and tortured - I see why you like him.
All damsel in distress like.
Like he thought it was funny, like this.
A common and everyday's scene from London streets.
And he seems quite happy
Acted like he was a sensitive artist, but he was "in love" with a lot of girls.
With an air of contentment.
Very proud.
From being included in his spotlight.
He wasn't quite there.
How can each one take two hours? Do - Suk, you can never do that much
Well, that's a weird look.
Like she's trying to get to know them or something.
I love you.
I already learned to live alone.
And judge me like l'm some kind of criminal.
He's compensating - all this bossiness.
Oh, no I'm too cool to be in love.
There's five fingers on a glove.
Uh, one half of a couple all of a sudden.
How about a pair of handcuffs?
A deck of cards, a bird or a man.
Pack of cards. Nothing funny about them.
A stretcher, No problem.
With a vehicle versus pedestrian collision.
A new glider. This is amazing.
A new pair of reading glasses. They're from Malaysia.
You got a new body, a new life.
A new face,
One of my priceless oil paintings
Know it all.
Like it was nothing at all.
You always appear exhausted.
One boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting.
You're like one of those victims
They're ready to deal. They're practically begging for a deal.
She certainly looks perky.
Which is in itself a living thing.
I could do all this with a pair of binoculars and a thermal vest.
A pair of binoculars and $40 in cash?
Hoping he'll glance over here.
Looking like his favorite cat just died.
I am a pervert.
Nothing gets me talking like a Cosmo.
A carnal shell
You probably don't even care.
She's just bland like her pictures are okay,
And then pretend to be so very unengaged?
Like that 'll help you think.
Showing off is what it is.
As if love transforms people and changes molecules.
A deck of cards, a bird, or a man.
A deck of cards, pack of marlboros,
Every position in the deck is a location in my memory palace.
How many 2S in a deck? Four.
The bald little sycophant that he is.
As if her life was over.
It's a man's face.
He looked awful.
And a climbing harness.
A picture of the emperor
Pair of glasses. Oh, here's another cat.
Yeah, real tough guys.
Complete sell out mode.
Criminal types. Those were his words.
Criminal types. Those were his words. And big into Santa Muerte.
Mr. Nice guy, the car, the Romeo stuff.
Old and rich.
An earring. I found it.
The floaty face of the wise bird, hovering on a million quotes,
A portraiture.
You see a film 100 times. There's nothing else to do.
That "Nora has a plan" look.
And a pair of those special gloves that 'll let me handle the wire.
To achieve a sound that impress the voters.
And a set of leg chains to keep you slowed down just a little bit.
Thinking they had all the answers?
Walking around acting like they're better than us.
And act like they the stuff. What?
The walk of a self-satisfied Persian prince.
Hungry little guy, smells like horses.
What about matching lace gloves?
Full of piss and vinegar,
With his tie and his stickpin.
A misguided sense of revenge.
Beaten down by a cruel employer.
All prepared to be devastated about it.
Wanted to make sure I heard his side of the story.
Always on the attack. It's ugly,
A pencil drawing of Pele, done in the naive primitive style.
Just ready to go.
A shell, an addict, who could possibly Dieof his addictionunless something changes.
I can't be a wuss and drive at the same time.
Verging on haunted.
With her stupid - ass file of evidence, and I told her,
And a pair of those special gioves that'll Iet me handle the wire.
A pair of those special gloves that I'll let me handle the wire
Picked herself up county clothes,
I have a real nice voice.
With an extremely cold heart is still here?
And gloves that look like rocks.
A mask. - that's the welder's mask we found at the scene.
Face like a bust shoe.
A gut shot straight draw? Are you kidding me?
Invasion of the citiots.
A bridle and a saddle
As in a skeleton in the basement of the house you and dad owned.
And a pair of bIack gioves.
All Zhivago like,
It's absolutely me, and I can't pass the buck.
The lawyers in my office.
As soon as that's done, we're gone.
One right does not make up for a life time worth of wrongs
1 plus 1, even.
So one plus one.
Why isn't there a boiler in boilermaker?
One plus one equals three.
One plus one makes two.
One plus one, does it make one?
One plus three should give us four, green.
One plus three equals two?
A plus B equals a tie in.
One plus five equals six.
A gallon of vodka and a lit cigarette.
Gallon gonna be enough? You been looking at my house?
Which at about 8.3 pounds a gallon comes to.
Yeah, a gallon. OK, that should be.
one gallon of stove oil,
How much does a gallon of water weigh?
What kind of gas mileage do you get with this?
60 miles to the gallon.
Twenty - five miles to the gallon. That's great.
Four miIes to the gallon?
What's it get like a mile and a half to the gallon?
Fifty - seven miles to the gallon.
And it gets 30 miles a gallon, city.
A situation incited by a gallon of sake,
Of bleach, a tarp and a hacksaw in the trunk of my car.
300 miles a gallon and the engine will run like one half its age.
The gallon milk jugs which are the high - density polyethylene.
A single gulp would suffice.
33 miles to the gallon.
A gallon of wheat grass juice, a five - pound wad of tofu, some jellied zinc.

Did nothing.
So still,
wouldn't move, wouldn't talk.
Motionless, without touching me.
Not moving.
And he hasn't moved.
Very still and very quiet, until it's fading away,
Looking to pin the butterfly?
He's real still and I'm thinking "why is he so still?"
He's real still and I'm thinking,
You stay driest by standing still, and the faster you move the wetter you become.
He's not even moving
Sticky hands and no manners flanking our door?
Resting it lightly on her shoulder.
It won't budge. Forget it.
The best thing is to do nothing. We're at war. We must act.
Is no turning around.
Don't move, okay?
Face downward.
She was just lying there, small as a bird.
Frozen and I'll walk out of here with my buddies and that 'll be that.
She's completely paralyzed.
So stay very very still and hold your breath.
Hold it right there.
Don't you move a muscle. Don't you move.
And yielding
You move and there's no telling what they're gonna do.
We move him, mine explode.
Stop right there!
A big house. A huge garden.
Moving makes space will make you sink
Any movement and this whole field lights up. Now move the men back.
If you move, somebody might get hurt.
Feels like someone's grinding an ice pick into my ribs every time I move.
Every time I move, it hurts.
I can flip from its back to its feet in one move
Kill me tell me.
In the middle there.
Frozen.
A zoo breeder was killed by a gorilla
Forever.

Ten generations in the future.
Not do a day?
Just get it over .
And take down Galactica once and for all.
Birth control for an entire nation at once!
To crack down on the uprising once and for all.
For good? Like a cure?
The score of a lifetime.
To temporary problems.
One spoon.
And spoon - fed me that bullshit, and I ate it up!
One cream. Two sugars.
A splash of milk, 2 sugars. That's me.
One sugar and just a drop of cream.

One for you. Two!
Peanut butter on a spoon?
One of honey.

Suddenly, the whereabouts of Jonathan cold are no longer recorded.
Before they knew it, the band was getting offers all over.
It would take too long to explain it.
And suddenly, whose life are you saving now?
Within that second, I couldn't think of one optimistic thing to say to her.
For a minute, l thought he was you.
For a moment my hands were not my own,
Slipped and fell on him and killed him stone dead.
I don’t have a suitable candidate just yet
Going over some options.
A whim?
Fuel to the fire.
For kicks? Economics.
A whim. Maybe not such a good idea.
On a whim.
The whims, the demands, the athletic assignations.
I just came by on impulse.
Heat of the moment... And all that.
On a whim, I pulled the financial records on the residents from the home who passed away over the last few years.
Impulsively purchased talking level, check.
Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?
It's a phase.
Little biter and my behavior in a moment of passion
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Just had this impulse.
Sudden heat?
Well, things happen in the heat of the moment.
And, in a moment of passion.
One of those impulses that grabs you, but so far we're okay.
Don’t you have any self - control?
A fling, you know?
Well, it's a simple crime of passion, isn't it?
Just 'cause her girlfriend likes a big rack.
Your impulsive losing of money at the stock markets.
Didn’t think when l bought it
Oh, total impulse. I hope it's not too much of an intrusion.
It can be dangerous listening to your impulses.
I had an urge to see the house.
We decided on the spur of the moment.
A fling! You know, we were young.
And on a dare, I hotwired a car, I got caught.
So on impulse, I put my hand on him.
Heat of the moment, maybe.
L came here on a stupid whim.
The occasional murderous impulse,
They don’t give you the death penalty for crimes of passion.
One - time impulse killers.
A crime of passion.
Something rash.
Crime of passion.
A crime of passion? It certainly looks like one.
That happiness born of passion is always short - lived.
Heat of the moment.
You felt a twinge, it was your heart and you're dead now.
He's not going to be back for a while.
That's enough for now. - yeah.
And they won’t see anything for a while.
It's probably gonna be a while.
There's not enough time for you to make it all the way -
This'll take a while.
This is going nowhere fast. We really should go, grandmother.
Don’t you write your old man off just yet.
It's not like they're gonna change anytime soon.
Well, I can’t explain now.
Comin 'back slowly, but surely.
It's gonna take a little more than a minute.
It won’t take a minute.
About all the things we should have done for this good man.
He won’t be back for a while. I'll tell him you called.
And I don’tintend to die anytime soon.
Lt won’t be anytime soon.
And he ain’tscoring anytime soon.
It's complicated, but I'm okay.
It doesn't look like it's letting up.
Got caught up in a moment.
It takes time.
Won’t be back for a while.
Will be gone most of the night.
Yeah, it's gonna be a while.
I won’t have proof positive for a couple hours, but.
I need time to find it.
For a bit.
Must be overwhelming.
It's a long story and I'd hate to have
Can't really socialize 'cause I'm running late.
Which is more than I can say for you.
Before there's anyone to see me who matters.
Things are going to be busier all around for a while.
Be patient.
It was thoughtless - fine.
And suddenly it's all woebegone maidens and dramatic deaths.
Little slips happen.
Temporary lapse in judgment.
I'm so careless, I almost missed you
I lost control for a minute.
Lucky shot, lucky shot.
Because of one mistake
Of his confederates.
I'm just stalling
I mean, it was just bad judgment.
No, no, not so fast.
Grew lonely.
Sometimes, you treat him nice. Other times, you hit and scold him to death.
In the far reaches of the quell system.
Quite a glorious pair for a while - very Nick and Nora.
You scared at all? No.
Lt's complicated, but we're gonna need a different house.
Forgot.
Heat of the moment. It'll never happen again.
It just slipped out. - it's okay.
Of course you were thrown off balance.
And been inspired to add some finishing touches.
Spur of the moment. Sorry I missed your birthday.
I slipped my mind.
An old habit... A friend kiss.
When it didn't happen right away, I - I wasn't too worried.
One minute, you're closer to someone than anyone in the whole world,
I lost control. Brilliant.
For panicking, for turning this into.
No, I don’t think so.
Well, I can’t think now.
Can't think of his name now. James Noakes.
The name escapes me now.
Don’t know off the top of my head, but I could check my time card.
I'm blanking... Who was it?
I lost my mind and wanted to commit suicide.
One day she's into safe. Next day she's into sexy.
In a moment of colossal stupidity, I panicked and told her I'm not ready for sex.
I panicked.
And was frightened
One or all time losers.
This has all just been too much.
I get bored.
It was in the heat of the moment,
To do without it entirely.
And I panicked.
Won’t leave here that soon
In a moment of weakness, and I feel better. Thank you.
Spur of the moment, seemed like the right thing.
So I've run out to ease the steam.
And with your blood boiling, you went to the professor's office,
I lost my temper and fought with him
Really, just heat of the moment.
When I first saw you at the club.
Slipped your mind?
Never have an ashtray in this town
She got loose somehow.
Having more man than wit about me, drew.
Having a moment.
I started out to prove something, and now it isn't important anymore.
Stupidly, yes. We received the leak.
Misdemeanor stupidity.
With a crime of passion, is it?
Driver's license in the one place of their last attack.
Slipped your mind? Oh, for - right.
A moment's ecstasy, a moment's excuse,
A fling.
In a momentary feeling toward her.
Acted on impulse,
A moment's distraction can change the duel's outcome.
For the time being, yeah.
Over our own hearts.
It was just a phase. It's over.
Temporary setback. I got it.
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
One moment of deception.
Be cruel to be kind.
A momentary cessation of stupidity.
It isn't worth buying off
But in that moment of weakness, they lost everything.
Sometimes a little discomfort in the beginning
Be rash sometimes my neck is on the line!
Nobody springs to mind.
It's just an infatuation. It's nothing.
It's a lot to hear.
I can’t believe I'm hearing them.
Stupidity?
That she's lost her reason.
Well, I didn’t know.
When you did what you did.
Confused? I'd say so!
Everything that's been goin 'on.
It has its moments.
Heat of the moment. Whatever.
Only temporary?
In a moment of colossal stupidity,
It's like a red mist or.
It's... It's hard to explain.
For a moment I couldn't remember.
Lost his head.
Complicated.
You sometimes say here, sometimes there.
It just slipped out of my mouth.
To learn English!
One lapse in concentration, one wrong judgment,
You cannot be blamed for being weak.
I believed them and went to gamble.
I still can’t pay you now.
Good in the moment, not so much in the long, tedious haul.
It's hard to say at this point.
Uh, not off the top of my head.
It's too soon to tell.
It was a mistake. I'm little, you cheat big.
With a thousand thoughts at once.
Everything was going wrong at the same time.
Once his first compositions began to be played around
Is going anywhere anytime soon.
For a while - but only briefly -
This is a lot to process.
For a while, almost every building that went up
Laughing and crying all at the same time, and you never want it to end.
And yet such power, that for one single moment
Whilst at one moment the bold hills
Unlock everything at once? Fast and efficient?
Can't think of any right now, but,
I think I was
We didn't have any other leads. I thought, what harm could it do?
And for a moment, it was like being back there in the dark again, just the two of us.
It's hard to accept so many questions, but sometimes.
In a moment all the world can change
They were just spraying bullets everywhere.
Flowers were now driving a huge increase in the diversity of life.
One. Time's up.
I got caught up in the moment, it was a rash decision, but I changed my mind.

At one time, then, the town must have been full of tanneries.

A lot to take in.
Doesn't make much sense out of context.
I wasn't used to it at all.???
Elena: it's a lot, I know.
It's a little hard to explain, come on.
Creates quite a bond.
It felt right.
A brief fling... You're not alone in this.
We got carried away and had a few drinks
A momentary effusion of too much good cheer.
It's just infatuation, I suppose. I'm never there

I don’t give a damn Pu? To, you bugger off now.
You couldn’t even give a shot, dammit!
Not a drop more.
Don’t spill a drop.
Use every drop.
Don’t spill a single drop, or I'll kill you
Not a drop.
And I haven’t had a drop, and, yeah, do I have a clear head?
Not a drop on the sofa.
Not a drop. Belly is benign.
Not a drop is missing.
Not a drop spilt. Very good.
One drop of Adam's blood and you free me.
Without a drop of human blood in sight.
Getting wet from the spring rain
Have mercy, public for this servant of the Lord
A little sweat goes a long way.
One drop will cure any injury.
Only a drop.
You only want to take one drop.
At a thousand dollars a drop.
Drop by drop
Not a drop. Me, neither.
Not a drop. - mm - hmm.
A whole universe in a drop of water.
Not one drop of water is to be spilled, sirs!
The microcosm is expanded by a single bead of sweat
I didn’t have any! They were right there, in the middle of the road.
A teardrop rolls down my cheek?!
The single tear drops,
And he didn’t shed a tear because he didn’t care.
Not even an itty, little bit.
Landed the bird with outa drop of fuel.
A tear drop away.
One tear.
Did a tear shed from Jang - hoon's eye.
One tear and they forgive all.
Drop a tear in my wine glass look at those big eyes
Without shedding a tear,
Not a single tear, and she got married during the great famine.
Don’t shed a single tear.
Not a drop. What a woman!
He hasn’t spilt a drop of that tea.
A drop of scotch... I mixed it with a sleeping pill.
A drop of grape soda, a teaspoon of golf,
You don’t have to waste any.
There's not a drop of blood.
A trickle of blood divided my forehead in two.
A drop of his blood killed Robb Stark
A drop of blood, a strand of hair, one finger - print... Could solve a crime
Every single drop.
There's no blood in it.
There was no blood. Just a bump and blurred vision.
One drop, you might as well be drinking lemonade.
One drop or two? Would you like another?
Not a drop. Nada.
Not a drop, you understand?
And don’t spill any of that, remember. Don’t worry.
I can’t waste a drop. I'm saving it all for the book.
Not a drop less.
Don’t drip.
Just a drop? No.
And never lost a drop. He ought to be able to hold on to your water for you.
Hardly a drop. She's fully clothed, so probably no sexual assault.
Not a drop. And has there been any undue stress?
A ruddy drop of manly blood, the surging sea outweighs.
A single rain drop raises the ocean
One raindrop raises the sea
A drop of musk.
The "one drop" rule.
When it's happening, baby, I mean, it just feels right.
At the plex foe midnight show all week.
A real backwater, huh?
I guess I got distracted and forgot about it.
Wound up in there on top of him.
In all the excitement I forgot to do it, so.
One round of eppy.
Making 400 cupcakes in one batch.
You must die
To finally make a big splash.
With one shell.
One on Chiang Kai – Shek’s bed, one on his table.
One in his bathroom,
And I'm gonna shoot you right out into fuckin 'Jersey, okay?.
Because of her stupid commercial,
The only shot is to be perfect.
The illustrious Siu man is a whore
Man: a bomb has been placed in the offices of a known environmental criminal
Then hung would be the first to die.
A little.
Penny a point?
A quarter after one.
Just a smidgeon. A skosh. A dab.
This is not a piece of information you wanna be out in front of.
To always give every ounce of the love in our hearts.
Every last humiliating bit.
Of drops well - gathered
Outside long shot of a chance for happiness here.
with the little things he'll do
Drop - by - drop over thousands of years,
Was worth every bit of it.
I will trickle my disgust into them
A little bit? A little bit?
Bird by bird.
Little bits fall off.
Little by little, you and all the other plastic surgeons
Little by little, you start to change.
And little by little, you understand
One small step at a time.
And then some, okay? Till it's done.
A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!
Bit by bit,
Just tap the gas lightly.
Little by little you can find the feeling place of it,
One little piece at a time.
Little by little, I had to stop it, of course:
And little by little by little, they took away what they owned,
Get the buyer and the seller inches away from closing.
Take a little bit off at a time.
Taking more baby steps to free yourself of your fear F the outside.
Nickel by nickel.
Poison more and more of it
A little somely and more and more deep
Blow by blow, they wear him down.
Yeah, a little - little exercise.
A little bit, a little bit.
Soaping each other up?
They soon grew, little by little,
Search a spot and then move on. Okay?
Just take your time.
Take a little money for your time, you know?
Taking all the fight out if it until it truly is broken.
And slowly started picking up the pieces of their lives.
A little? You have limits?
Just gradually,
Baby steps, okay?
One teensy, itsy - Bitsy speck of information
Piece by piece, starting with the children.
By my own hands.
Just nibble on it.
Bit by bit, it has pieced together
I will give you a play - by - play of my memory.
Then, as with him, it will consume you entirely,
And little by little, we forgot it
And one by one, blot out all the memories
It's terrible for a little by little
Little... Little dreams together.
Little by little, the mud forms either new river bank,
Little by little, the business went downhill. Finally it went bust.
Weakening it little by little.
This little by little is really little by little.
Just inch over. You worm your way.
Bit by bit. It is time - consuming.
He took little pieces of me.
Uh, slow build.
Tiny bits of timesaving
Just being slowly bled dry
Literally cracked the code.
Aces, aces, aces... No aces.
At 1:45 am.
Zero - one - thirty - five,
Zero one - thirty - four.
A little of God's grace,
A stack on a stack on a stack.
The most ambitious guy in the world.
A little?! Yeah! He thinks if I don’t molest him, it means I don’t love him!
Not of the person you're speaking to.
I haven’t a shred of an idea.
I don’t mind at all.
That is not surprising. No doubt that tentacled demon.
Not a bit. Great!
Or to cause him any harm at all.
An American's ability to become a lawyer.
That doesn’t hurt a bit. Turn around.
It's gonna be very painless. And I'm gonna put you back together again.
No, you look.
It doesn’t surprise me.
Not exactly worth living for.
It's not worth it. Takes up your whole day.
It wasn’t even worth it, that's the worst part.
Exactly!
Nothing less.
Tis certain he hath passed the river Somme.
Sam: no kidding! Ginger: and I still get my money.
Indeed, Mr. Paine.
Really is. Thank you so much.
Damn right! "Blackass," y 'all!
Is not stupid.
You don’t look stupid.
Looks nothing like him.
Hardly seems like something an illicit boyfriend would do.
So unlike your owner.
You're not yourself! It's the ring! It's the ring.
A lot different than the Conservatory back in St. Petersburg.
Nothing like jet sleep, right?
And it didn’t.
It doesn’t sound like Ella.
Is none of your damn business.
I don’t have anything left.
There's no trace of it. Explosion worked.
Not impress her?
Nothing involving technology
Nothing involving technology. No, nothing.
It's not. - morning.
It's not ridiculous.
But that's not funny. - funnier than the truth.
Yeah, it doesn’t surprise me. He was bitching about the money all week.
Hardly a shocker. You've always cut history.
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Nothing more, nothing less.
It's undignified.
And that's a fact.
No more, no less. He's a bully.
You did sing the song.
Literally. Ranked. You gotta have one or two.
Literally, I'd rather shoot myself.
No surprise there
Not surprised.
Why am I not surprised?
They had a special bond. I wouldn’t be surprised
Shocker. These videotapes must be retrieved.
I wouldn’t be surprised; with that shitty HMO.
Not surprising, since the most common initial symptoms
It was not good at all.
Nothing good. Somebody put the trailer on the net.
It wasn’t fun, that's for sure.
It's not funny.
Not funny, daddy.
Cold.
Not even a smile?
With a battery up his ass!
That's not funny. No - 20.
This is not funny. No, I'm sorry. It's not funny at all.
No. Not perfect.
Unafraid.
You're completely, exactly right.
Smug, self-righteous sneer, and it sounds like a heroic advance to me.
A little misfortune and you're giving up.
A touch of unhappy childhood.
No kidding, that's how they are.
It is not forced. It is beautiful.
Five grand worth of eyelashes and not stick around.
No shame at all.
I'm not busy at all. I'm bored now
None fucking at all.
The mere suggestion of impropriety
Not at all.
Haven’t missed him. Always treated me like scum.
Not hard for you? Used to be.
No surprises there.
Of course it is. It's textbook.
Of course. - come on, J - bird.
Knows nothing of the royal law.
Knowing nothing about music, and starring in bloopers,
Not at all. Not in the slightest.
That doesn’t rhyme. It's gonna get us places faster than shoes.
Not worried.
Far from bored.
Little does she know what awaits her.
A little? Try 45 minutes.
Aren’t dumber than the people who make television shows.
No romance.
It was just unattractive.
Doesn’t make me uncomfortable at all.
Nothing doing up here.
Not... Not at all.
That didn’t hurt.
You won’t even feel a thing, I promise.
No limp. Not even close.
At all? It's his soul. It's gone.
I don’t think it's crazy. What's your name?
I did not.
Not a clue.
I don’t know nothing about any kidnapping.
So not helping.
Not really. I'm real spinny.
Doesn’t even sound familiar... Like a babysitter or something?
Slightly. There's nothing wrong with
But happy.
Front to back. Give me a break.
Keeping it real, walking in the crappy dog park,
All of it! All of it! Let's go, let's go.
Nothing worked.
What, at all?
Charge you guys full price? You're family.
No. No, I don't. I... Aw, shoot.
No bullshit, zero - two! Yes, sir!
But they don’t look like killers.
Not like a date.
Not at all, Betty.
No, no, no rush. It's an easy job. Three and a half minutes and you're on your way.
She's all wall and no flower.
It's little enough to ask, and I shall never let you go.
Not at all, MS. Marchetta.
Pretty close.
Because she's feeling a little weak?
It wasn’t.
Not cool, Alex, not cool!
It just doesn’t.
Unimportant.
It's not important at all. Sugar, love?
And he is.
Give the man a prize! About a year and a half ago.
Just, just. And the men are like the mastiffs
Yeah, that's correct. He owns it.
Goddamn right. He's never gonna know what hit him.
When might that be, exactly?
Exactly. Plus, the little guy is kind of starting to grow on me.
Exactly. If I'm with you, then I'm with you.
No more, cousin. Nay, cousin
Exactly, minister.
Who said I didn’t? Blimey, you know everything, you do.
That's right. That's right. She is in my hands.
Exactly right. Good, Linda.
That's absolutely true, you know?
Abso - fucking - lutely, man. We oughta chalk this one up.
Exactly. We have options now.
Yeah, I'm smarter than that chair.
Hell, yes, I deny it.
It is very true, my grief lies all within;
Exactly, and I do give up.
That's right, I said “weird” twice, to emphasize “freaky”.
You're absolutely right. That's why I had to... I mean.
That's exactly right. Yes.
That's right, Jacob. -... French?
Exactly! That's precisely why I've called you here.
That's correct, your honor.
Right. - here you are.
Absolutely, sir. Yeah.
Not much. Trust me.
Not at all. - she's stronger than she looks.
Not at all, mother. One false alarm can easily lead to another.
Actually, no, it's not.
Ungrateful.
No trouble at all.
It's no trouble. I had to stop next - door for my dry cleaning anyway.
It's not a problem. They're just down in the basement.
No trouble, I swear.
It's no trouble. The drugs were found in his refrigerator.
Just a few things.
A little something to eat?
A little something to get you into second gear.
We haven’t eaten a thing,
You haven’t eaten much... Nothing at all.
You haven’t learnt anything
A little time alone, okay?
That don’t actually have a personality and can’t really dance.
Absolutely no idea. I mean, can you imagine?
...- er than you are now,
They don’t even check you in until 1:00.
Windows are safe until one o'clock.
No pleasures,
He never gets to have any fun.
And you're not Hing any fun.
Absolutely. Hey.
Decidedly no. Uh - uh!
Not even a little bit?
Not even a little bit, not even at all.
Not in any... You were just entranced.
Nothing like nesic.
Not at all. No.
Not at all. I'm ready to master the avatar state.
Of course not. No. Absolutely not.
Not at all. No, no.
It was like amateur hour.
It's not... Serious.
Not at all. Why?
No, not at all. Why? Does it freak you out?
It’s just not sanitary what's wrong with people?
And not do a damn bit of good for anybody.
Not long. At all
Never gets stale.
Oh no, Joe! Last year I was a dork with braces
She doesn’t see me at all.
So I didn’t know about love.
Not even a little fight?
Not at all. It's the desert, Arizona.
No pleasure in that.
There's no such thing, dear.
I don’t complain of none, dear boy.
I wouldn’t mind at all.
No, not at all. Okay, be right back.
Not at all. That would be cute.
Not at all. They said that stain would come out.
Not at all. He was gay.
Not at all. He's kind of an underground sensation, though. It's brilliant.
None at all?
Not at all. You see, I'm not really interested in women 'a la carte anymore.
That's not it at all. You just don’t think I'm fast enough anymore, do you?
Not at all. I was actually gonna bring someone myself.
Not at all, lady Catherine.
It won’t be damaged, not even a scratch.
I wouldn’t mind it at all. I'd enjoy it.
No, not at all. That's ridiculous.
I don’t know what you mean. I had a lovely time.
Don’t be. It’s nice. I get to see you every day now.
Don’t be. It's nice. I get to see you every day now.
Not at all, I love him.
It's no bother at all.
No, it's no bother.
It won’t hurt a bit.
Lt doesn’t hurt a bit. Come here.
Not at all. Okay, have a good day, all right?
Uh, not at all, Lex.
Do not even a little... Erotic?
Not at all, it was therapy.
No but.
I don’t mind at all, but -
It's inconsiderate, never mind rude.
Not in any way. You were just in a trance.
No, not at all. You're just getting it all out.
Not at all. Why do you think so?
No, not really. You should've tried out.
No, not at all. Ls your ringmaster scary?
Not really. Do you?
Not at all! Just relax. You're doing just fine.
Not at all. You’re a very pretty girl. You should know that.
Not at all. Age suits you, Brutus.
Not at all. Y 'all are in great shape.
Not at all. You look happy. Last time I saw you
At all anyway, you know.
Not even close. - you sure?
Not at all. You've said so.
That's not corny at all.
Of course not.
That's not tacky at all. All black.
And you were.
Not a lot of makeup
That does not sound stupid at all.
That's not dumb at all, because.
That doesn’t sound dumb at all. I completely understand.
Doesn’t sound like her at all.
Which is not at all like a rainy afternoon in March, by the way, prior.
No, it doesn’t. Not the face or the figure.
And nothing civilized about what we're doing here.
It wasn’t like him at all.
Nothing like his dad.
It's not like any bacteria I've ever encountered.
He doesn't look like you.
Doesn’t sound like you at all. Why not? It's completely me.
Not very doctorly.
Nothing like saliva boy.
I think there's nothing gay about it.
That doesn’t look anything like backwards to me.
Nothing like flying first class!
With un lady like effort,
He is nothing like her.
Yeah. Nothing like pussy.
And they werert even married yet.
Rather than happy as he usually was.
Well, I just don’t think that's very darn Peter o 'Toole of you, dude.
Nothing like, uh, your old assistant.
Not exactly what you'd expect from the son of a teacher.
I think that more than anywhere I've swum, felt like what Ronald Hutton was talking to me about,
This doesn’t look like a country at war with itself.
Nothing like a well - deserved evacuation of the bowels, son.
Can’t have been invented
Not really. That's funny.
Not at all. Flowers and fruit.
Very UN - future cop.
Damn all samurai, anyway.
It doesn’t work like in the movies.
Not like the man at all.
There ain’t nothing natural about it either.
Nothing like a murder - suicide to fuck up a great house.
It didn’t smell anything like that.
Sure as shit ain’t any here.
He didn’t look anything like that guy.
It wasn’t. It was good.
Not a whit, sir.
Not focused at all. He's blurred, sir.
And there's nothing glorious about it. Nothing poetic.
Okay, that's not fair.
It isn't fair and you know it!
About plants.
Is none of my business?
Not excited.
No, not at all. Actually, it's exactly what every ex-boyfriend / houseguest wants to hear.
I'm not surprised.
It's not weird at all.
Which are not in the least exploitative.
Oh, it's not a rager at all.
And there's nothing simple about it.
Out of the way, no clutter.
It's nothing dangerous.
It's not dangerous.
Never mind the desperate people outside the walls.
Just totally unfriendly
It's not very neighborly at all,
That's not morbid at all. It isn't.
Not at all. Only.
Over the head with a bag of popcorn.
It's not scary at all.
not a bit reprehensible
It ain’t cute.
So not funny.
Lt's no fun anymore. L know, l know.
Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn’t recommend it to every woman. But you?
Not at all, Mr. Spock.
Not even. Surprised?
We're not impressed.
No, they need that plane for more evacuees.
When you saw Alice with me.
Doesn’t make sense.
It doesn’t make sense -
You want me to see you in such a state?
No regret at all
Not having any... Second thoughts?
Not creepy at all.
Not at all? Not at all.
Does not contain chalk at all,
He wasn’t slurring or anything.
Not at all. Sounds like fun.
Doesn’t make any noise.
It goes nowhere for me.
It's not sexy.
There is no match. It's not even close.
Not at all. As good as you. Better, even.
Unobtrusive, sir. See, look it.
Actually, no.
Not at all. It's just the opposite.
Not at all, my velvet Vindaloo.
Don’t like it at all.
I don’t like you, you're a bitch.
Not at all. Um, who shall I make it out to?
Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist.
It's not about that at all.
And not care?
And they don’t care tuppence for what the world thinks of them.
I don’t care. - I told you, I'm trying to.
I don’t care one iota about that - what I care about is the dead girl in your client's house.
He couldn’t care less what I was doing.
Not really. And I get it.
I really couldn’t care less.
Not worried about the FILM, are you?
Not bad at all
Is not complicated.
Well, what's complicated?
Lt's not complicated I'm having this baby.
Not a bit, more than you can imagine!
Not at all. A few hundred francs. I'll give you 1,000.
I'll check if we got it at our other store.
Not nearly enough.
It's never innocent.
Not at all. Very well.
No exaggeration,
There's no spinning this.
Not at all! Look at my dad!
That is not fantastic. This is a disaster!
Is hardly exotic... And it's painfully dull.
And it didn't feel weird at all.
It is hardly surprising
Wouldn’t surprise me one bit. With two outs?
It's not weird. It might help.
No wonder they left it.
It's not weird.
Not at all, 'cause you're not. I'm on TV.
Well, not so strange for me. I come every day.
This was not a surprise, the enemy had about 30 minutes
Not surprising, really.
Not at all. Women should stay sexy until they're wrinkled up like a pickle.
Not at all. She is very nice.
Not at all, she is so thin that can get into anything
Not at all. She was a perfect little lady!
Not a bit! She was brawny. And strong as an anchor!
Not at all. She's a normal college kid.
Not at all. Not fair she looks so good.
Not any more. She's in total command out there.
Not at all. She was perfectly contented.
Bad idea.
It's not fine.
It's not fine at all!
It was not good at all. Do you know what I mean?
Not even close! Can you handle this?
Not nice at all, Camil!
Not good at all, maybe they have arrived the border
Lt did not taste good.
Not very nice at all, my love.
It most assuredly is not.
That's not nice. Good. It wasn’t meant to be.
Not very hospitable at all.
No, not "yay." Bad.
It does not feel good. It hurts.
It was not fun.
It's not funny
That's not funny. That's not funny.
That was not awesome. What's wrong with you?
Not cool, brother. - Oh, come on.
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
Not okay. Okay, that's addicting.
Lt's no fun, stuck in a dump
That's not funny. What am l supposed to do in the meantime?
It's not funny. I'm saying I'm your dad.
It's not much fun. I'm sure.
That's not fun. Trust me.
It's not fun. When you get it. It sucks.
This shit ain’t funny, trick.
That's not funny. They almost charged me with reckless endangerment.
It's not fun. It's not fun to lose.
Not at all. Okay.
None whatsoever. All right. Well. Please send her in.
It does not look cute.
Not finely
Nothing like a nice boob. What is your problem?
Ain’t nothing funny about it.
Get lost from here!
That's not funny. That's not... Is that video?
It's not funny. - not funny.
Not funny, Aaron.
That's not even remotely funny. "Guy off my ass," my ass!
That is not funny. Do you know what she did to me?
No funny stuff. What are you doing?
Not funny, you know.
Nothing is funny. You're dying!
It's not funny! Stop laughing.
That's not funny, freak.
That's real funny, Jim.
It just wasn’t funny. Listen, I'm going to get into it.
It's not funny! Hey, why are you such an asshole all the time?
Not funny. In some cultures, dogs can guard corpses,
That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
You're not funny. - okay.
It's not funny. Seriously. Completely.
Well, that's no fun at all, is it?
It's not funny. Let's get a robot, you and me.
That ain’t funny. And you don’t talk while we're on the radio. Now sit back.
That's not funny. I'm not joking.
You're not funny! Pretty sure I am.
That's not funny. Had to get your attention.
That wasn’t funny. I burnt my tongue.
It's not funny... One pull of a trigger and there lies the prey
I don’t like that story at all, it's kinda of sad.
It's not funny, dad.
It's not funny any more, Jennifer. You don’t understand.
It's not funny. What am I supposed to eat?
Not that funny a story. Not really even a story. Just like a fact.
No, it's not. - okay. No, it's not.
Not nice at all, and that worries us,
You're not funny.
Well, it isn't. Mom.
No! Mom, you look perfect.
Not at all, my ass!
But that's Nick,
Not one that minces words.
Not a euphemism. Look, I... Wait, what would that even mean?
Not at all. Venice does not change at all. Venice is the same.
It didn’t look hippie or Woodstock at all.
Not at all. Puzzle.
That's not old-fashioned. It's important to me, too.
No security.
Not in the least. Not at all.
It's not perfect. It's bruised. They all are. See?
Unafraid of any of it.
It isn't easy at all.
It's not easy. Well, not for you.
It isn't easy, it's heartbreaking. I love John, but it's not blind love.
It's not easy, and on some level,
It isn't. You can do it.
With no respect for the working man.
No respect.
Treat them with such disrespect
He gives me absolutely no respect.
It ain’t small. It's mad big.
It's not small at all. It looks a bit small.
It's not overkill. It's business.
Not at all, major.
You should be very proud of yourself.
Not awkward at all.
That's not a bad time.
Not bad at all. Actually, pretty good. Right?
Not bad at all, huh?
Hot presentable at all
No, not cool.
Oh, no! He was hideous.
A little poetic justice.
No, not at all. As long as you need.
Not at all. What can I do for you?
There was nothing happy about it.
I wouldn’t bet against it,
No room for doubt?
I don’t like her at all.
Not even a little?
We're not in a hurry.
Not hot.
It is neither funky nor hinky,
Don’t be all shy.
Not a bit. Well, you should be.
That's not too flattering.
And it 's, uh, not disgusting.
They weren’t obscene! They were sweet.
By our current accommodations.
Not sad.
I wouldn’t be surprised.
I'd absolutely hate it.
No, you're not, dude.
I - I don’t want any of this.
That's like the last thing I want to do so from now on,
Not remotely.
So do not want to know why.
Just didn’t want me at all. Yeah, okay.
Just didn’t want me at all - yeah, okay.
I never wanted any of this.
Doesn’t want to do it anymore.
That's not a shocker.
I'm not surprised. He probably called the governor.
No surprise there. Stop it, I'm blushing.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!!
For anything that may have happened.
Not a hint of irony.
I haven’t understood a word.
No understanding of reverse engineering.
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.
No appreciation for the art of conversation.
You are too straight.
Is totally unacceptable.
Not at all. Been working all morning with that romance novelist,
No way. I'm not going to let it get me down.
None. No, nor do I.
No! They're gonna kill one of us.
It wasn’t cool at all. We come out to gather information.
Not at all. Where were we? Right, first Seattle.
This is not easy, okay? I don’t have a choice.
Not at all. I like being a millionaire.
Not at all. I was aiming for mysterious.
Not at all. I like Yanks.
No not at all. I'm from Las Vegas.
Not at all, I almost married an Anatolian.
Not at all. I have to knock him.
No, not at all. I actually feel great about it.
Not a bit of it. I'm your bloody hero, eh, old scout?
Hardly. I teach grade school.
Not at all. I'm a very charming sponge.
Not at all. I'm very intense, and I realized the importance.
No, no. Here's a positive.
Not at all. I came to hear your side of the story.
Not at all. I do not.
Not at all, baby.
Not at all. I see you are judging me. I don’t know what to say.
Not a bit of it. I have it on the best authority.
It's not. I can feel it.
Not at all. I think you would feel empowered.
Not at all. I'm fitting out my house.
Not at all. So you better not do it again.
Not at all. Go ahead.
No bother at all.
Good for you for not worrying about your husband's bachelor pad.
Not worried the slightest about your uncle?
Not caring what anyone thinks.
It is not encouraging because Bruce saw Jack at half past three.
Don’t go with the whole Brooklyn artist thing.
And you don’t mention you were the one who put her to bed?
That wasn’t awesome, John.
So unbecoming,
Got you on speed dial.
No trace of admiration?
Not at all, the whole city's infected with bedbugs.
Not a good time at all.
Totally inconvenient, no way she'll be on it.
It's not convenient, and it's not fair.
It definitely wasn’t boring.
It is not boring!
Never a dull moment, Kai.
Never a dull moment, huh, babe?
Selling that condo is ludicrous.
Not in the least, but I'm so turned on by her brain.
Not at all. I don’t know Denise.
No, not at all.
Hell no, if I wanted to scare you
Oh, not at all.
Not at all. What's going on?
No. There's nothing funny about it.
Not that funny. No. - no, no, not at all.
Hardly fun, dear.
It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me?
Not so funny, really.
Not unknown at all.
Ha, hardly.
There's no wiggle room with forbidden. You're cursed, man.
Not at all. Death is natural.
No less difficult than obtaining the index from the CIA.
And not one bit beneath us, and I intend to marry him.
No more than I am well acquitted of.
Not French at all. He's American. Oh, well.
Not romantic.
It was not romantic or intimate.
It's not romantic, it's delusional.
It won’t take any time at all.
It's not overstated. No, no. She'd like that, the queen.
We're not low.
It's not ridiculous at all... You're fired.
Not a bit.
Just untalented. It was a nightmare. I had to fire her.
Not at all. You have a very unique style.
No bell.
Doesn’t love me at all.
Nothing special.
Not special.
Don’t think twice!
No hesitation.
Has nothing to say about the real world?
Utterly unimportant.
Oh, not even a little bit.
I didn’t have to work at all
That's not scary at all.
There's absolutely no rush.
Don’t even worry about it. I got a guy who'll take care of it.
Not the "half, maybe apology, hope for the future" thing.
And we never use dirty tricks
That's not that crazy at all.
Not so crazy after all, huh?
You don't. Right.
Didn’t even sting!
It doesn’t fucking hurt
It doesn’t hurt.
I got no pain.
OK, now this isn't going to hurt... Me. You gonna be a brave girl?
That wasn’t so painful, was it?
Lt won’t hurt, very interesting indeed
It barely even hurts
It didn’t hurt.
I hardly feel anything.
Didn’t hurt. When I pulled out, it was fused at the shoulder.
It don’t hurt none, Charlie.
No hard feelings.
Not a word of faith.
It's not easy, trust me.
Hell, no. Saved by the bell.
Not even a little bit. What a waste of my day.
Not even. - really?
About any of it.
They're not. You know why?
They didn’t even know what we were shooting
Treats girls like dirt. Okay.
None. What is it?
I'm not sure at all! What am I doing again?
It was not magic.
What else is new?
It's not sudden. Preparation, preparation, preparation.
Doesn’t fit. What doesn’t?
That is not like me at all.
But now, it's just not efficient.
That's not dumb at all.
It wasn’t easy, but from a crowd of 12,000,
Nothing simple about it.
Ain’t no easy about this, okay?
It's not. It's not manipulative.
Lt's not working.
Regardless of what it may do to thunder?
It's not corny.
Not the least bit rude or repressed.
Not delicate. Like chunky.
Not at all. Not everyone has to have children.
Not so bad at all. If you're a fucking squirrel.
Not nervous at all. I'm not nervous.
Not in the least.
Oh, not at all, darling. I could go all night.
It's not sweet.
Without a bit of romance.
It's not beautiful!
It wasn’t pretty.
Who's not inte11igent enough to understands that she wants to have a chi1d.
Huh, out in the world?
Out in the world.
Not even a little? I can’t.
Not a word. My lips are sealed.
Granger: no. I was just kind of excited to meet them.
Is that not a bit embarrassing?
Nothing selfish about that.
Definitely not rain man.
Not hard at all
That is not ridiculous.
It's not there anymore, though grandma says she was tricked
Not any more. I still hope though
Not anymore. I still hope, though.
No chemistry at all.
There are no stupid fights!
Not for one second.
Really still.
Don’t matter at all. You know god made black beautiful.
Don’t interfere with my love life.
There is nothing to be nervous about.
Is far from constant.
Oh come on, skipper, play fair.
It doesn’t feel dangerous at all.
Thought it wouldn’t be weird at all.
Not even by a little.
Lt came as no surprise.
Not at all. Bring it out. Okay. Let's go.
No memory of it at all.
No, nothing.
There's just no sense of accountability or follow - through, self-reliance.
That's not irony.
Oh, no, that's not weird.
That's not spooky. Used when?
In any way. Thank you,
Not at all. Thank you, miss Fraser. You may sit down.
So unlike the other iandlords.
Nothing like a little light reading.
That doesn’t sound like you.
Yeah. Nothing like pussy.
Nothing quick about that.
Nothing like an early morning walk in the old Canadian outback, I always say.
It's not very Frank - like.
Not like those morons from kurnigsburg.
No bother at all. There's little enough to keep me busy at the manor.
Shouldn’t take long at all.
It's not weird, it's cheap.
You weren’t pitchy at all.
You didn’t make contact with me at all.
It's not exactly glamorous. I'm not looking for glamour.
super-mild.
Might have a little habit to hide.
Not at all. I can’t tell you how many times I've been to a charity or a social event
None nearby.
It'd be wrong if you didn’t. Still on a diet,
Hardly. It's not the first time.
No, not at all. She deserves it.
Not at all. It's a wonderful effort.
Not at all. Does this hurt?
No - come on in.
Not at all. Come in. Good.
It's not far at all.
Not at all. I'm always ready hours ahead of a concert.
I mean, this dress does nothing for my body.
Doesn’t head up at all.
I'm not sorry. I like this area.
It's not. Who did it? Kehoe, Frazier and me.
Quite ruined her complexion.
And not in a cool black way.
No, it is not cool!
It's definitely not exactly cool, huh?
It's not cool. It's terrible.
And of no importance.
Lt doesn’t matter
It so doesn’t matter. It so does matter.
It could not be wrong
Ten out of ten, Sherlock.
Exactly! Now drink!
You may be right!
It's not hard.
That is not difficult. He's out there.
It ain’t hard, man.
No, it's not difficult, sir. It is simple.
It's not, not torture at all.
It's not bad at all.
It wasn’t so hard, was it?
It doesn’t need anything done.
And there is no need to panic at all.
That's now spit - worthy. What gives?
Not at all. You be my guest.
To pay any attention to mine.
Without the least regard for my privacy.
Whether I want it to or not.
Think of my principles
Doesn’t do bumps. Did your daddy buy you that?
Very UN - sneakily, and it was really awkward.
Ain’t no trouble.
It won’t pain me!
It was no trouble. The basket with the red ribbon is for your guests.
No trouble. Summer's here.
No trouble. I'll wake you at first light. Fill your belly with some food.
It's no trouble.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's newspaper.
Not at all. If there's anything we can do, be sure and let us know.
You're causing us no trouble at all, please.
No trouble at all. It's served raw.
This is no bother at all, officer.
Not a - yes.
Don’t move at all.
Be very, very still. Okay.
You're quite welcome.
Don’t worry about a thing, big guy.
Don’t fuckin 'drop any of those.
It did not. Leave me be.
Doesn’t exactly help,
Without losing the slightest bit of my sunny s
Witnesses will say we were never near it.
Not exactly. Not in mathematics. I could do with some private lessons.
Hardly at all.
Nothing? Not word one.
It's nothing at all. Mama.
Not at all. In fact, I slept with him last night.
Not at all, dear.
Lt's nothing special at all. Well, I think it's special.
It's perfectly OK, officer. I forgive the little rascal.
Not the least. The less you stick out the better.
Not at all. you do!
Infringed on no one's civil bloody liberties, used no intelligence gained by torture.
It doesn’t matter one bit.
No problems at all!
Not familiar with it.
So selfish.
Like he hadn't gotten any older.
Haven’t changed a bit! Gee, thanks.
Heard it at all.
Literally, I'll pull their plugs.
How could I forget?
That is not funny at all.
Not cool, brothers.
I didn’t get that at all. Went over my head. I don’t know.
There was zero chemistry.
Not at all. I just want to focus... Let's just focus on the case.
Not distracting me at all.
In no way personal to yourself?
Does it mention him at all?
At all. Yeah, that's right, that's right.
Not much changes at all.
It hasn’t changed, Stan.
And you're about to have even less.
Any feeling there?
Not interested in.
Not a wink. Not since I got a bed to myself.
No power at all.
Not really. Who is that?
Nothing, guys. Nothing.
Fucking anything. But you fucked me about.
None. Do you understand?
Not at all. You liked it so much.
I 'the world honest Ned, none.
I didn’t deviate an inch from the route, repeat, didn’t deviate!
That it didn’t matter
Not one little bit! Get out! Why are you doing this? Hey.
I couldn’t help what happened: he's been drinking.
Without any wings at all.
That's him all right.
Didn’t transform at all.
Not a shred, but we're just getting started.
Nothing? No names, no associations? Not a thing.
Over nothing?
Nothing at all? No positive ID.
Even a little bit. Dr. Hodgins.
The millicents have nothing on me, brother.
Not at all. Oh, and guess what.
No, not a word. - strange.
Nothing. - all right, all right.
Not a trace. Completely clean.
None that remain means there was.
There's no sign of Jang, chae - min or whatever her name is.
It's not like he's the boy's father.
No, not at all. Good. Me neither.
Not an expression of the joy kids are supposed to be feeling.
It looks the same
Not at all. You sounded controlled, even - handed, statesmanlike.
Not a bit of it, you couldn’t have arrived at a better time.
No, not at all. Think about it. Yeah, really? It seems that way.
Like no life at all.
I ain’t seeing none of that. Let's go.
Not at all. I.
Nothing - I'm genuinely happy.
Not at all. I had three nearly feral brothers.
Ever. I just want back into the business.
None whatsoever. Can I go back to sleep now?
We didn’t slow down. We just.
It isn't. The gear change is awful,
Nothing's changed. I love you.
Not even a little bit, so, you know, relax.
Nothing, whatsoever.
Quite harmless in its current form.
Not even a little? No.
I don’t feel much like a party.
Not at all. I mean, it’s - it's amazing.
Not at all. Really?
No sign of any bruising at all.
That I didn’t think at all about the future.
Not even one second.
He didn’t even try to swim.
No, not at all. Just be brief. I don’t have too much time.
It just makes no sense. Right?
No problem at all.
Not at all. No difference.
Didn’t matter.
Not at all. See you.
And leave nothing behind.
You are not helping your cause.
Not red at all.
You haven’t aged a day.
No pain, nothing.
Doesn’t go nearly far enough to solve the PHYSICAI side.
It doesn’t make me curious. No.
That ridiculous show?
It's not getting any easier. I just spent the afternoon with a couple of dykes
Never gets any easier.
That makes a lot of sense. Don’t you want to be loved?
Absolutely right!
A destiny? Yes, exactly.
Yeah, I thought so. Huh?
Yes. Exactly.
Yeah, you're damn right they knew we were gonna bug them. And they knew how.
That's right but if no stranger came, that means
Absolutely I do. You're not serious.
Absolutely I do. Oh, you're not serious.
Absolutely I do - Oh, you're not serious.
Tell me about it. I just hear that name, and I shudder.
Hell, no. Oh, God!
Damn right. Hey, I'm getting tired
That's very nice. In Chinese, the number 42 sounds
You're damn right she does.
All true. What are we going to do about it?
Real tight. We move as fast as FedEx.
You're damn right I kiss like a guy, like five guys.
Of course she can! I could not be more delighted.
Without a doubt - Maggie, what are you thinking?
Without a doubt. Maggie, what are you thinking?
Exactly. Now.
You said it, Tony. Good luck.
Exactly. That's where I'd go.
You're God damn right that's pop talking.
That's correct, sir. Thanks for your help, Mr. Looney.
But there's no smell.
It's totally true.
Well, that's not very encouraging.
Not at all, no, but I did scrape what looks like that shavings from both the cranial fracture
Oh, you could pass for a native.
I can’t see that at all.
It doesn’t look at all like Anna Karenina.
We can’t afford any delays.
For a bit there, eh?
Not remembering it and all.
No memory at all? Not a thing.
And they don’t make any sense.
A bit of a mess?
A minute piece of latex.
One o'clock. Lunch time.
Getting away with it every day.
They're just gonna let you walk away?
You're okay.
Here's something that l was hoping that you might
None of it really mattered.
We're going to be just fine here.
And everything will be fine.
Never better
Nothing at all, actually. I was just saying, I'm a little.
$1.2 billion.
A buck fifty. Highest I'm going. Done.
It lacks that human touch.
Not even a drop of human kindness
All remnants of human emotion.
A bit what?
Something - something in her manner that makes a man take off his hat.
What?... Fruity.
We didn’t really change anything.
And there's no sign of them?
Damn, he's early.
Okay? That is a sad and freaky situation, my friends.
I don’t hear from him anymore.
It's a small price to pay.
And then she picked up something at the gift shop a little after 1:00.
One o'clock down at the quay.
There's no marquee value. But this Balboa thing is interesting.
Was for nothing? We didn’t do all of that.
So lacking in bigness. Does he really have to go back next week?
Is there any praise?
Not even a little sniff of a whisper?
There's not a scratch on it.
I didn’t even get a scratch, not - not a scratch.
No place at all.
Oh, it's whining about a little chill in the air that makes me wish you were in Alabama, too.
Been swallowing every day have been for nothing?
Won’t do a scrap of good.
It's not helping.
Not even close.
A little. You?
A little? Are you shitting me?
A little? Have you seen the forehead?
A bit, you know.
A few things?! You maxed it out!
Can’t we get any eyes in there at all?
A little faith.
See how far a little trust can get you?
A little good - faith trust never killed anybody.
A little bit of trust is in order.
No word from him.
No bloody radio!
You don’t have any conviction? Aren’t you a professional?
A little info on.
Not a shred.
A little shaky? I hate weddings.
Any signs of letting up.
Some of your health foods or something?
A little like I'm trying to get my bearings.
Just a small.
Some. Some?
Little by little, and I was silent.
That wouldn’t be any fun.
Not cool. I am speechless.
Well, it's not funny.
It was so tight and crisp.
Unsafety in such perilous circumstance.
Not retarded suffering from insurmountable credit card debt,
And a bit wild,
Precisely.
Exactly, bill.
Exactly, and when the business gets bad enough,
That is a no - brainer.
A little squid.
I'm not surprised at all.
It was quite painless, I can assure you.
None whatsoever. You doubt me?
It's hardly worth.
That's not his thing.
No moves at all.
And no wonder. You're selling lifelong happiness.
It wasn’t anything dangerous.
Not at all. A little daring, perhaps. I wouldn’t recommend it to every woman. But you?
She doesn’t obey anyone.
I couldn’t care less!
Not even enough minutes. Did you get those proofs?
His sperm was found in her oesophagus.
Nothing good about it, I assure you.
Not fun crazy.
This is not cool. This is definitely not cool
Not fun at all. Maybe we should go back to the clarinet.
It's not terrifying. Why?
It's not scary.
In no way blame you.
That wouldn’t surprise me.
To what this guy had to say.
Not at all, no.
Not a moment of complaint.
Not a bit, no. I got a lot done.
That's very literal.
It's not boring.
No trouble at all. I love babies.
Oh, it's never too hot.
Don’t you worry a thing.
It wasn’t crazy at all.
Don’t hurt at all.
Quite painless, really.
No, not at all. As a matter of fact, I'm very proud of my wife.
I have no idea who he is.
It's not amazing.
Not surprising. Hot engine, thousands of gallons of gasoline.
No piercing, no tats.
Not in the least, my Lord.
There's no shame in this.
Lt isn't very puffy.
This is not going to get better,
You're not even close.
You're not at all wrong. Now, where's the boy?
Not long at all.
Wasn’t hard to say, after all.
Don’t leave anything.
I couldn’t even offer a clue.
Cocaine? No, I don’t have any cocaine.
You haven’t changed a bit
Not anything?
Hadn't aged a day.
Tell me about it.
Never get a look at his face.
Happened.
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Totally fine.
Some bit of salacious info to which you alone are privy?
In which you revealed absolutely nothing about yourself.
No reception, what about you? What?
I've forfeited all rights as a father?
Wasn’t never about that.
A little work.
It's an idea for a song.
No use to us at all.
A little bit of excitement, maybe score.
No activity at all?
There wasn’t even any pressure.
Not exactly family friendly here.
A little me time.
There's no noise. Are they shielding from electromagnetic radiation?
Ain’t there even the ghost of a bit of bacon?
A little grass, a little glue... Not during pregnancy.
Two eighths of weed doesn’t exactly make me Osama bin laden.
A little religion isn't gonna kill you.
A little accident.
Just a small sum.
And some cash that you can readily afford.
Well, a little.
Hint of chocolate, spice and dried fruit.
Not a bit of breeze out here.
My compliments.
Never even crossed my mind.
Doesn’t even make sense to me.
A little, dare I say, love?
A little retriever. Some shih tzuu. My chihuahua is a little rusty, though.
A little poison?
a little bit is never enough no, no, no
A spot of petrol where you tried to clean them
It's true.
Yeah, you're damn right it is - your mess.
Exactly. Oh, fine.
Yea, you ain’t kidding.
You bet. Ow.
You bet! I like it already. I can’t believe.
Exactly. Wolf, how was that for you?
Nailed it. Bring it in here, monkeys.
There's no energy there.
That's not helping at all. - ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
It does not.
A little sincerity can be a very dangerous thing.
They ain’t got no respect, blood.
Wasn’t any sugar left. Must have used it all up.
A suspicion of parfait amour, a hint of orgeat,
A little old - fashioned hazing.
A little aloe will do wonders for that combination skin.
A little wine and cheese action? Yes?
Not even left some money for us
And I scratch yours with sealed planning records.
And rightfully so.
Not one bit.
Knowledge of Joe's health conditions.
You don’t understand women.
This won’t hurt a bit.
This won’t hurt a bit, son.
Not at all, honey. Yeah.
He doesn’t look Turkish at all.
It's unsanitary.
It's not dangerous because it's not a gun.
That's not pervy at all.
It didn’t work at all.
It's not even scary.
No it's not, Because she's still in love with Mike!
Not functioning together at all.
Not so big.
It wouldn’t surprise me.
Not weird at all.
It doesn’t even taste that good anyway... - but still.
It’s not exactly glamorous.
This is? Not fun
'cause no fun, right?
It's not funny. I don’t want to go.
No, it wasn’t any good.
That's not even remotely funny.
Not funny! Oh. That was funny.
No more weirdness? No.
No weird areas here!
We don’t want to get off it.
That doesn’t even rhyme.
Nothing special. You know, coach, I've been working out a lot since grammar school.
It didn’t even hurt. Good.
It really didn’t hurt that much.
I'm not... I'm not buying it. Come on.
No. No clue.
Not easy at all.
It's not that at all. What is it, then?
It's not gonna be hard... Do you mind?
It wouldn’t be any trouble.
It wasn’t about me at all.
Don’t give an inch. Yes, sir.
I'm not finding any release documents on this guy.
Not a trace of it.
None. That's the first one, and he hasn’t touched it yet.
Not even a trace
Not at all, mummy.
Doesn’t even matter.
Not even. Really?
It is right where it should be.
What, no money at all?
She really didn’t miss a beat.
No question about it. Look at the flame on that one.
There was no proactive statement issued on this.
A little extra homework and you get sick
The heat is rust - coloured.
A little witchcraft, I suspect.
Didn’t have an inkling, positively eerie
With a little photosynthesis, you will feel like a new.
We use hot rollers.
Some gossip, it's kind of personal.
A little something for the uninformed masses.
Nothing a little TLC couldn’t fix.
It would not matter at all.
That the woman standing outside is a knockout?
I'm not connected to other people, all right?
The night she died? - I didn’t have an argument with her.
At all. Okay.
None at all. It's a little icky, actually.
Not a problem.
And her stupid, smug baby!
Had nothing to do with it?
It doesn’t matter anyway.
Totally unrelated. It has nothing to do with Stephanie.
Doesn’t make sense. I mean,
Really not interested.
Have any interest in changing sections in the lab, for instance?
In what she has to say? - no.
In the proceedings of this court martial. Therefore.
In the porn industry, you know what I'm saying?
Nothing happens in it.
A little piece of yourself that you never get back.
It's gonna take a hell of a lot more than a little snow and ice to bring him down.
Little prep work, one machine, works with lasers.
A bit of cold water.
One shell... One ounce of whiskey - down the hatch.
Do we even have a clue who did this?
Not a scratch on it. I know.
It's not creative.
You're useless!
Tape everything.
Not a mark on it.
There should be more to it than a lot of little tingles.
A little sharp.
And before you know it, bang -
Are the sun and the moon Village at 1 o’clock, okay?
I will be there before 1 pm.
From the implant.
A little cut - it's nothing.
You're like a wet rag.
Never wasting a fin stroke.
You don’t show any strength at all.
What a feeble chicken!
It's just so small and so weak.
There's no charge to them.
There's just no way to stop it. Anyway, here's 9F down here.
There's nothing to be done.
No way at all?
So there's just no trace of her?
You're killing me.
So I don’t have a move?
There's nothing to do. I'm done, finished.
There is still nothing here.
Nothing's coming up or going down.
Every little creak he heard was a monster.
You haven’t felt it move? - nothing.
Since Irina disappeared.
Real quiet. We didn’t even hear a shot.
Quiet as a grave out here. No sign of target.
A bit of help wouldn’t go amiss.
You spend nothing, but you have cigarettes
It sucks. You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about
And I... I'm exhausted.
You are weak.
Doesn’t say anything about medicine,
It's a quarter after one.
Stopped at 1:15 in Harlem.
I have a conference call at 1:15.
1:30. No excuses.
1:30. You won’t make it in time.
1:30 am Washington DC
Is 1:30 okay? I might have a thing later.
One - thirty! I must get dressed and go!
He had it at 1 :30 and when he checked again at quarter of 4:00.
There's a 1:30 and a 3:30. We could see one of those.
At 1: 30? The ticker - tape wouldn’t have been running.
Is the 1:30 show sold out yet?
A little game theory. A little sun Tzu.
Well, l haven’t the foggiest because it was so long ago.
Not a word. Why?
Nothing rings a bell?
So, there's no danger in it at all? No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.
So much for harmless. Fine.
Well, I think a little real danger might suit me,
Of instantly combustible liquid.
A slice of history. - and where is it?
The slightest pressure and it snaps... If it isn't wrapped up in a little heart.
Not a single piece of original thinking
In a little audience participation.
A little friendly competition is good for the soul, don’t you think?
This does not look good.
But I wasn’t even aroused!
No response whatsoever.
Nothing? I mean, what, should I check for a pulse? You alive? Hello.
You're frozen stiff.
Nothing happens. Lt won’t even turn over
It's not even twitching, so.
Over the hospital's cable policy.
A little Primatene might just help to clear that up there.
A little old school detecting would do you good, my friend.
Just a little. Just.
Little - just a little tap water? Oh, sure. I have that.
A little something called evidence.
But one thing's for certain
A little? You can say that. - yeah.
Not a shot. Sorry, pal.
On this earth.
Out of the realm of possibility? Completely.
Not even a chance? No.
What about some food?
A little cooperation here will go a very long way.
Can you meet me at the grill room at 1:00?
On the whole "roommate bonding" thing.
With absolutely zero compassion.
You have no sympathy
No bloody regret on his face
A little follow up. Has your husband tried to contact you, Mrs. Gerard?
Kind of, yeah. I ran into him couple times by the mail boxes.
Kind of. I didn’t really study that hard.
A bit. I am a bit.
Maybe a little. Or not.
An inkling you've got me.
Not even a peep.
Nothing interesting.
Some, uh, plastic sheeting
Neither a little taste?
It doesn’t have any taste!
There is no flavor.
It's so bland, it doesn’t even taste like kale.
Is there no hope of a reconciliation?
A bit of swearing.
No indication of a bite wound at all.
You've lost your touch.
Ain’t got a bit of class.
He seems nervous and startles at every sound.
Not even a discussion?
Can wet least talk about it?
Bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie.
A little. I was in a feminine product commercial.
A little white lie not gonna hurt you,
A little blood lust suits you, Octavian.
A little bit. Yeah, you can tell.
Little bit? Yeah? Maybe a little.
Little bit, yeah, I do.
A bit of, uh, chicken, my little dove?
Slightly?! Hey, let's see you fly one.
Something in return?
Not even a little payback?
A little? Riley, you're an amazing story of survival.
A few hail Marys, a little acyclovir.
One hour at the corner of water street and 49th.
See you at stoke park at one.
One o'clock at the quay.
One o'clock, here.
See you at one then.
A little oomph? A little oomph. Get it?
A little Mexican, enough to get by.
Too quiet.
Not a bleep.
Jumping at every noise.
Absolute quiet.
And it was totally silent.
There was no life left in him at all, right?
Don’t make a whisper.
Very, very quiet.
Not a sound.
Where a sound might have
A bit of noise can have such an astonishingly powerful effect on us
Extremely quiet. Just say something, all right?
Don’t make any noise. No, honey.
Not a fuckin 'sound.
A little petty cash.
A little "old school" is what this team needs.
After one o'clock.
Tina: a spot of supper? Jenny: you've heard of supper.
Um... A little, maybe.
A little bhang can make people feel high
Some talent, lots of luck.
Some innocence, sweet mischief
No talent at all.
A few talents? That's what you're gonna leave me with?
1:00? Excellent.
One false move, believe me, and my men will be all over him.
Got a little hair, little spit.
I don’t need a doctor for a little headache.
And still don’t have a clue. And,
I'm very confused.
I had no idea.
And depression for not being in love!
I have no clue.
Not a clue, but I do know where to look it up. Follow me!
I don’t know. Do you remember anything?
Not a clue. Well, there you are then.
We don’t have a clue where to start.
We're nowhere yet. I mean, looks like a blade.
Nothing comes. It's... Driving me crazy.
Something odd.
A woman's touch. I've left Angier.
OK. A little cheese and pate - always good after a heart attack.
No cheese drips, no grease stains.
Nothing left of her.
Just, like, bring it in a hair.
Modicum. Right.
No good comes of it. Believe me.
It's not good for us at all.
A bit? Okay. Two bits.
One o 'clock. Right.
1:00. Great, rabbi. Thank you so much.
And no signs of any improvement.
A little bit on the feminine side. - a bit gay.
An inch of truth makes the lie hard to spot.
A few script changes, hmm?
It's not like family.
Nothing like home, nothing at all.
Not even a quadratic basis to work with here.
No competition. It's ridiculous. Winning shot.
Just a little tip for the future. I am always right.
No respect for the hunter?
A little dignity.
So what's a little dignity?
Just the littlest bit of respect.
There's no respect anymore.
You have no respect!
It's just a little something I whipped up.
A little trifle, a little - you know what I mean?
What do you use them for?
A little something to remember me by.
Just something come up.
It's a little favor, a tiny lie and you're theirs.
It's nothing important. Just a little security glitch. Mm.
And a few worries mean more worries.
Always making a mountain out of a broken nail.
Didn’t need a lot to make him happy
And the smallest of things could annoy you.
And he's had people killed for way less than just snitchin 'on him like this, for real.
Little things made her happy:
A little, uh, emergency.
Uh, one small thing.
Not even one tiny little thing?
Minor accident. LAPD's on the scene.
Little thing about me is - and this is the funny part.
And if a breeze, someone should jostle him, something like that,
No harm done, ma 'am.
Little tiny things annoy us a whole lot more.
People judge you for every little thing,
Darn things multiply like rabbits.
It's the little things like this that make me giddy.
You can get a varsity letter messing with us.
You know how she worries about every little thing.
A little bruised.
Few bumps and bruises - nothing the South American sun can’t heal.
Little camouflage... Huh?
Nothing wrong with a little cheating.
A little paranoia... This went to shit fast.
Oh! That? Just a little noise. Are we good?
Yeah. Little perk of the job.
A little bonus.
Hi. Just a little office token.
A little professional courtesy would make this a lot less awkward.
A little thank - youfor coming through for me.
A little bit of gentle pressure did the trick.
A IittIe different with a IID on.
A little hanky panky would have been - we don’thave to do.
Little reconfiguration to the staff.
Every time he gave you
That a little deviation may be exactly what l need.
Little advice? Let's go in your office.
Getting your brother off with a slap on the wrist!
Just a teeny note.
It is only a slight setback. No need to panic
They need a little lesson, don’t they?
A tiny bit of power.
A simple spark could trigger the explosion.
A little fact - checking confirmed my suspicions.
Just a little thank - you.
One tiny problem.
A little black - and - white noise.
A little privacy, please.
Bit of work, only for the day.
A little humor breaks up the day.
Bit of advice,
Little word of advice.
Bit of advice - you really don’t want to upset me right now.
Oh, well, a little advice. Old houses, old pipes.
A little treat for my favorite officer.
Some small favors,
I could have used a little help.
A tad ominous, don’t you think?
L got news for you, little brother - that wasn’t mud.
A little story, nice lighting,
Just a little surprise.
A little surprise. I hope you like them.
A little extra.
Lt's a small token of appreciation.
Lt's not much, but... Don’t worry about anything
A little something for all your efforts tonight.
It's a little something, just because I love you.
Something to keep you warm.
'tis nothing, I swear.
A little gift for you and your boys.
Small change. You can’t put too high a price on loyalty, eh, no Liza?
Just a little something.
Lt's just a little something to say thanks.
Just a little something to remember me by.
Here's a little something for your trouble.
Por favor, stay close this week with us. Lt's our honeymoon.
An appetizer.
Lt's a small performance.
From clay Aiken. What?
Neat trick. You like?
Maybe just a little trick. Catch the killer.
A little torture looks good on you.
2,000 bucks' worth of contraband for a little show - and - tell?
A little setback, we'll get through it.
Bit of a setback, I'll grant you, but we're so close.
Small contacts. - standby.
Just a little tip. Going for turn one, just keep it down a bit, be lower. Stay below the bumps.
Little tip - the salmon's her favorite.
Little advice: I mean, obviously the village people
Just one note.
Little disagreements.
Eh, a little catfight is good for friends.
It's a graze wound. Minor tissue abrasion.
Just old scrap, no big deal.
So that you might remember to be a bit more forthright in the future,
From anything, anything at all.
I think I can handle a little air, Phil.
Nothing wrong with a little romance.
They cooked up here in the lab.
A minor irritant.
A momentary pause.
Little something I call “the George Jefferson”.
Jerky treats. What are you talking about?
To go along with that, no extra charge.
Bit of business, if we can find it.
Don’t need medicine for minor ailments
Just a little bit sick, that's all.
There's a bug going around. Nothing to worry about.
Just a small slit up could ruin everything and BAE'll walk!
A little perspective. I could use their take.
A few bumps and bruises along the way are a small price to pay.
A little housewarming present.
Here's a small thank - you
A housewarming - slash - sorry - I - ran - you - off - the - road gift.
A little something to remember me by.
A little gift, thank you.
A little lead.
A bunch of little things can tell you everything you need to know.
A quick wit and a mate to pick you up when you fall.
On that story you're writing about Elaine.
A little restoration to help you celebrate getting your license restored
It's a little kitsch to add to your collection for your new apartment
There is sort of trinket you carry - I carry nothing!
A little nudge "? Tell that to whoever was in that boat.
Well, a little warning would have been nice.
That was fair warning.
Little misunderstanding, huh?
Penny for the guy.
Not even a nickel tip.
A little wager, George. A flagon of ale. Yeah.
A little adversity can actually be good for you.
Little wine, relax conversation, you don’t have to do a thing.
A couple of drinks and a gust of wind. So much for you.
Uh, a little bit of money,
Very little money.
With coins and trinkets. That's not cherishing!
A small price for big excitement!
It'll take more than just pocket change.
A nickel would start me very nicely.
A little money.
You make a mistake here, people die.
With one minor.
Deguerin: just a little bump in the carpet. Nothing for you to worry about.
She had a little episode, probably triggered by me.
One glitch and out the door.
Just a little off my game. I'll get it back.
A little bit, you were off in the timing.
By instinct if anything is not right
Little bit of traffic. Just give me a second, okay?
A single raindrop is nothing
One little tremor, and it'll take your head off.
Now just a little toast to you, my beautiful -
A little magic here now, a little magic.
Just a little trouble.
How can a bit of dust be poison?
Little bit. Little bit. You ever been?
Uh, uh... Three bottles of opus?
T can burn easily terrific!
Just a little'll get him going.
Just enough.
Just a little more.
Gabby: just a little bit!
A pint will do.
Just offer her a bit of guidance every now and then, and the results are first - rate.
Almost there.
A little show and tell.
At about 1:00, Mr. Morton said that he wanted to take a nap,
Pick you up at a quarter to 1:00?. Oh, right.
There's no difference at all.
Ravitch: a meltdown isn't when one thing goes wrong.
One false move wipes out impulse control, personality.
One simple mistake can make love into hate
There was simply no hope.
A little. If I can help in any way, just ask.
So no hope there?
Didn’t help.
It didn’t help.
Didn’t help, did it?
Not helping take the day off.
Not helpful.
That is necessary to deal with the co_2 problem that we face.
Got no common sense
A little backstage tour.
An intervention.
Ever. Nothing. And you won’t find anything.
A little hay is nothing, huh? You don’t agree, eh?
.. And a little luck.
A little green gets you in between.
No sense of humor.
That's so devoid of humor.
Listen, word to the wise.
Little advice?
Some advice -
Word of advice - next time take the trigger finger.
Word of advice. Why not?
Piece of advice: you can lose your money,
Word of advice -
A bit of advice? When I jab you with my sword, you'll feel it.
A word of advice, speaking as a former baby. Don’t get too hung up on baby names.
Piece of advice? Charming's not the tack to take with us right now.
A little advice
Something exotic, perhaps?
Oh, an exotic little treat.
A little Vernon's rum, a little ginger beer and splash of tabasco.
A few shell casings and a building in Brooklyn prove nothing.
A little rape.
A little formality called paperwork.
It didn’t make no difference.
Not a whisper.
The big bupkes. Nada. He's not in there.
Nothing about travel to or from the UK at all?
No clue. - well, I can certainly tell you this much.
There's no sign of it.
I just wish there had been some warning, some sign that she would do such a thing.
A little. Good.
That must have been hard.
A little lawyer humor.
A little? This is phenomenal.
Extra cake's in here.
It's not much. - Maggie.
A small token of our gratitude.
Best I can do. - thank you.
I am not well prepared
A little, little cardio, uh,
Toss in a pinch of history,
It's busy but, you know, it's a job.
A stone around my neck
Couldn’t help it.
That's not helping. Fine.
“A little”! Listen to her!
Doesn’t qualify as helping.
And this is not helping. I'm sorry.
A bit of unsolicited advice?
A word of advice, Spartacus.
Wasn’t that the least I deserved?
It's natural for there to be some grieving, some anger... Some denial.
We just need a little happy.
Not the slightest intention.
Nostalgia completely gone.
There were no doubts in his hands.
Not even a suspicion?
1 P.M.? - uh, you know, tomorrow.
I mean, no thought had been given to this at all.
Without the beard
Just a little toy for the bed.
I had no experience of my own
It's an odd thought.
1 must be lower than 6!
A little fear might suit you, I think.
A little love, a little dance.
A little - the cha - cha - cha -
There's not a hint of remorse. This unsub was determined and relentless, like he couldn’t kill these victims enough.
He doesn’t seem even remotely sorry.
She shows absolutely no remorse,
Where's the suspense in that?
No sense of drama.
A little surprise.
Have you completely lost your mind?
Thinking didn’t come into it.
No comment
A little to the imagination.
Don’t mean a thing
It makes no sense!
It's nonsense.
Doesn’t make sense. Not a good joke.
Doesn’t make a lot of sense.
It's meaningless. What you're doing
They never make sense, okay?
To be something you're not!
Lt makes no sense! Why? Answer me - why?
A meaningless distinction. What?
There's nothing to get, Kevin! It's bullshit.
There's nothing to get, Kevin! It's bullshit.
All that nonsense. I'm going to lie down.
It doesn’t mean anything.
Little excessive, but I like it. Come on.
I was an accident.
Accidents happen.
Yeah, a little caprese salad, a little gnocchi with pesto.
It wasn’t amazing.
Totally meaningless.
It is not interesting. There's no concept.
Just give what you can afford. Alright, well.
Oh, this sucks. I'm switching back to real sex.
It doesn’t make any sense.
It isn't interesting, it isn't entertaining, it isn't anything.
We're having no fun at all. Yeah, I can see that.
Doesn’t interest me. Cheers.
No fun at all. No.
It lacks expression of emotional attachment.
That's nothing?
I didn’t feel anything.
No feelings at all.
And you won’t even feel a thing.
Ha! I didn’t feel that at all!
I felt nothing
nothing 'on you
Well, no sensations at all?
I just can’t feel them right.
A little gratitude, some respect!
A little piece of anger or bitterness,
A little pick - me - up.
It's a little consolation prize
Not a nibble. You can’t give them away.
A bit. I opened it a bit.
A little. I'm going to grad school at the University of Barcelona.
My job description just a little.
A little? I had perfect teeth.
Not the slightest portion of my freedom!
A little person? No, I dated a little.
You know, the borders and outline of my Dick a little.
One, one. I'm out. Go ahead, go.
A little surgery, a little radiation,
Learning baby sign language.
Even a little talent will do.
Just a mild sprain.
You can’t stand the slightest remark? You're brave as a rabbit.
You didn’t promise me anything, what do you want?
Some technological differences.
They're pretty low - tech, using retrofitted late model cars
It's just a scratch.
All without a fight. - can we come and see you?
All without a fight. Can we come and see you?
They didn’t give me a pension.
Not a single sidebar. A guy has got to miss a hundred grand in cash and jewels.
A bit? Sorry, all of me has to come in.
A little paprika rub on a rare roast beef.
Little advertising tidbit
Will not come overnight.
We don’t have a single lead on who this might be?
Erased any trace of a print.
Absolutely no dust can be picked up.
Is no challenge at all.
You're not a challenge - you're a tease.
Challenging post. More challenging than dealing with Kenny Curtiss?
One jolt and this stuff could go, right?
Can’t make a dent.
A bit of control.
A little Jones maintenance?
A little tip for you: the new Mrs. Phillips doesn’t need to hear about this.
Warning, roof may be blown off due to excessive partying.
Grazed, yeah.
A few scrapes and bruises. He's gonna be fine. Just sign the form.
You just grazed it. Let me get you a band - aid. They're in the bathroom. Kiss first.
Not a scratch? A bruise?
Not so much as a scratch.
And there's nowt but dole coming in, at least I can sit there, too,
I haven’t even changed yet.
And kinda swing on a chair
Not a rad.
A little slack. Slack.
No, not really.
And have it sell ice cream.
But I haven’t gotten anywhere.
A little sensitivity, a little tact.
Just some clerical business.
No manners at all!
He's not educated, he's impolite too
A little walking around money.
It's one o 'clock, straight up,
One o'clock sharp, lunch with foreign Ministry.
Anything new to show us.
That's not even original.
Something old, something new.
Word on a new video that's just hit the Web.
Get some air.
Where's the melody?
Mm, boring matter of state.
Little morning coffee?
When it's one, it rings 5 times, and when it's 5, it rings once
It doesn’t look like a fashion picture.
Just a second.
A moment, will you?
A moment to think about how this all plays out.
How much time are we talking about?
A little time to look around me
Is just a little time to think about things.
Some time getting used to it.
So no time is wasted.
And this time there's no hanging about.
For one thing, he owns the house Geiger was killed in.
It's a lead - pipe cinch that she didn’t get it out of the building.
How much is “a little”?
How slightly? Six to nine years.
A little? Yeah, a little.
1:00? Yes, sir.
That this satellite was not accidentally contaminated.
It's a simple and common inflammation.
Never a spark of intelligence!
A little more... Basic.
A more adult beverage.
Little light reading.
Not in a way that I can use
Nothing at all that can help?
Is anything usable?
This case is nothing but dead ends.
A little salutary controversy the way
Some alkanet root, some deer tongue,
Not taking any chances.
Don’t even start.
You won’t even give us a chance. This treaty's been approved by the dail.
No prospects on the horizon?
No chance, huh?
You don’t even have a chance, unless you're the most ruthless.
You don’t even have a chance, unless you're the most ruthless.
A small technical problem. We're making a short stop.
A little “pied penguin” action.
No rights at all?
Not so high and mighty anymore.
A little apricot liqueur.
Pick me up at 1:00, and we'll do something fun.
Pick me up at one. I'll see you then.
A little muffin. They sure do give us our muffins.
A few coins, but no notes.
A little flexibility and balance work.
Some lemon - rosemary green beans,
And some berries and all that stuff.
A little bit of coconut
About what's happening here.
Never had no sense. Wasn’t your fault.
For the pain, but make sure
A little justice and I'm gone.
Are we gonna find any coke at all?
A little bit of gas poisoning should.
Every day. Much better. Is that grandma?
As clean as a new pin.
There's no rough edges.
No hair at all. - honey, your father isn't finished yet.
No grace, no charm.
Really dead.
A little sodium hydroxide, shut the lid, no harm done.
A bit of water will take it right out.
He's got less than nothing. Own it. You can do it.
A little scum could break the whole case.
He would have such a decent burial
A little smut won’t hurt you.
A little gas.
Done slid right off his cracker.
Harmless.
With never a false move or moment of hesitation.
It has not changed.
Not for the better at all.
Not a bit you're the same old you
It's no good.
There was just no question that it was for real.
Checking their mail, right.
Never occurred to me I couldn’t manage him.
No sense of mortality at all. Completely delusional.
I wasn’t aware that I was being manipulated.
Not at all. Two customers? We'll be talking about this for years.
The real story?
Flawless?
It's no trouble at all. It's my duty.
In any way whatsoever.
Nothing. But we have this corporate policy now.
Not really. You've had a fundamental mistrust of me before this incident.
A great center.
I'm not ready to go home yet.
No offense taken.
Nothing at all? No card at Christmas?
Nothing? I'm not a prostitute.
Not really. You had a fundamental mistrust of me before this incident!
None whatsoever. All right. Well, please send her in.
Not helping. I have faith that it is.
None whatever. We all know him to be
At all. I hope I'm not some kind of a psychopath.
Not one bit. I thought his decisions were real sharp and well thought out.
Hardly, my lord. It's just an eye.
Hardly, my Lord. It's just an eye.
Not at all, my friend? Oh, no.
Not a one. Makes me think the object was metal.
Without respect, as if to claim what isn't theirs.
And not terribly manly, and all this business.
In your mind. - that's right.
Nothing artifact.
Yeah, no question. So what are we looking for?
None at all. - good.
No problem there at all. So, is the real problem my age?
No trouble at all really, and I... I don’t mean to disturb you.
It didn’t work.
No brains at all
Didn’t miss a beat.
It is not fun. It's not entertaining.
Ah, yes.
Oh, yes, you are!
Exactly. A glorious reflective pool, to reflect my gloriousness.
Exactly, exactly. No, no, they're slower.
Absolutely. - no. Don! - in the best way.
That's correct. Perhaps I should be proming you to general.
Well, you were right. What idea?
Absolutely, they always are, Gail.
Absolutely. He didn’t ask me about al Qaeda.
Totally. He's well fit.
Definitely. It's just whatever it takes to win the war out there.
And rightly so... But I would still like to think
Exactly. You don’t talk to any of your exes, do you?
That's right! You fuckin 'freak! Top it!
That's true. Why are you sticking up for her?
Exactly - both you and the Chinese will know the name of the agent
Exactly. - you guys stay here.
Exactly. How LG have you been listening?
Not at all. You're confused.
Exactly. What have you to say to that.
Absolutely. Could you fix a meeting, sharpish?
Exactly. How could l ever think you'd be responsible enough to be a father?
Absolutely right. Yes, you're right.
That's correct and you are not yet a knight,
That's absolutely right. 10:00 Monday morning.
That's right! Our brother!
Exactly. Wow.
That's exactly right. She's on a tight schedule.
That's right. Okay, excuse me. Hi. All right.
Exactly, and if we 're gonna have any chance, then she can’t be here.
Exactly! If someone was willing to do something so horrible, I.
That's right. It was the best.
That's all it ever is, boy.
Right you are, son. The famous brothers Grimm.
Spot on, humpy. Isn't that right, your royal Highness?
It really was, sil.
Exactly. The flipper birds, that's you, eat the fish.
Totally. Absolutely.
It's all good. And we're going over there. Tonight!
Damn right, I dance. I can take you to where they are.
That's damn right. I'm so there, dude.
Yeah, looks don’t deceive. I barely got them out,
That's exactly who I am.
Exactly. How could I ever think you'd be responsible enough to be a father?
You have no idea. You're not supposed to know I'm working with the marshals.
That's right. I love you, Kate.
Exactly. I'm in the elevator. See you in a minute.
So true. Painfully true. And I'll tell you what.
Exactly. So what if women had a pay - per - view channel
Exactly. So what we can do immediately is make advertising on the stations illegal
Exactly, so I think I can control myself in a negotiation.
Exactly. So, either they're wrong or.
It's true, isn't it?
We so did. - yeah. I'm just coming out of a 15 - year relationship,
Exactly. It's performance anxiety.
That's right. You up for that, Yong?
That's right. See? See here.
You bet. Welcome to our herd.
Exactly, welcome to my party.
Right on, pop.
I bet. Know what could be fun for you?
Good point. Wait, wait, wait, wait!
That's true. Yes. And I -
It is very true, o wise and upright judge.
That's right, punk ass.
Exactly. The hit list. And he's got all their addresses and vital information.
Exactly. So the principle is the same.
Exactly. These aren’t her kids?
That's right. That was you.
That's right. Those 2,500.
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.
It only needs a little gas.
Oh, just some legal wrangling stuff, sweetie. It's okay.
Kind of earthy... And it's fabulous.
Some onion rings
A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot
Totally gone.
There's very little magic in the air. Ready the lower horn transport vessel.
Not a blade of seaweed, hasn’t been there more than a day.
Still no sign.
No sign of her?
No word. Nothing.
Any news?

One o'clock. Still just a potato.
He can’t even lift his hands!
Little bit or a hand full?
A little one or a big one? A big one.
One or a two one or a two
Something I've learned in 20 years with internal affairs.
A little bit of this.
Bit of this, bit of that.
A little? You can say that. Yeah.
Little bit of this, whole lot of that,
Yeah, the deadest so far.
There we are, back to square one.
There's been no developments?
Not giving an inch.
Some time away from the family
Without hesitating,
A dash of rosemary, a smidgen of thyme, a pinch of marjoram.
Not even a glimmer.
I didn’t get any kind of memo on that. He's kidding. Relax, mark.
You know, a little swagger. You touch the plate.
Without morality.
A peace offering.
It just doesn’t make any goddamn sense.
It just doesn’t make any sense.
I mean, it does make sense, right?
A little of that a little of this
No trace of that guy?
A little? Grandma's traumatized.
Never?
Zip!
Not one lick. Not one damn lick. Independent.
Different every time.
They're nothing alike
There is nothing seedy about that.
No pain at all? No. Why?
Not the worst at all.
They're not bad.
So useless!
Doesn’t appear to be handicap accessible.
Well, not long at all.
No lack of confidence here.
It's not pretty at all.
It's not confusing. It's simple. You won.
Not a bit of it?
Of Mr. Jonas old acre,
Oh, less than ever, but at least now it sounds like I do.
Extremely mistaken about you.
You don’t understand girls at all!
Look westward at all, and was not tempted by these foreign imports.
None. Then enlighten me!
Not at all. It's the truth.
That is not polished! I don’t know. Seems pretty polished to me.
Oh, not at all, dear.
This is humanly impossible.
Any little twinge there?
It's totally clear.
Not at all, but I'll bet you a nickel it won’t be pretty.
Not at all. Let's get another round.
No, I don’t mind. Okay.
No, not at all. I love cats. Good.
Uh, no, no, they, uh, they gave me a nerve block, so I don’t feel anything from the waist down, so -
It's not fucking funny!
None of it? - Nope.
No surprises, you know?
This is not encouraging.
The shop is chilly. And there is a fire here.
Without his love wavering in the slightest
Not at all. More the merrier.
Not at all. But somebody could think of the straw - to - matic - beat us to the punch.
Not at all, Mr. Wellington.
He doesn’t speak any English? No, no, no.
No bother at all. It's the least I can do. Please, come in.
Not at all, I adore it. The secrecy, the intrigue... It's most thrilling.
It's not gonna help at all.
Not at all. Jack values your feedback, and he should have it.
He couldn’t skate worth a damn.
It doesn’t hurt at all.
It won’t hurt at all. None of them felt any pain.
This won’t hurt a bit.
And every pie was perfect.
That won’t raise any suspicions.
And no light escapes the tunnel.
And you wouldn’t have to deal with him at all.
It'd be no hassle, and you'll be there by morning.
Ls about right, but I'll give you up to 80 Jeon.
We're not fine - you just cut him off.
Not a bit. You?
Not at all. I had a great time.
No, not at all. What are you reading?
Nothing like trust. Tell us what happened.
Like none of it. Tell him what you did.
But it isn't worth it.
Not worth it at all.
It's not worth the trouble.
It won’t be worth it.
Nothing of value.
They're not worth anything? I can’t bring them back.
And not at all fake.
That's right, come on
It's not silly.
It's not dumb. I love mom's beading. She made me this necklace.
That's not stupid, that's sweet.
Always no bunny at all!
Far from it.
It isn't like you at all
I'm nothing like you. Nothing like me?
Here, did you not look like a model at all.
I can never count on you to be Jewish.
Oh, it wasn’t whiny.
You don’t look a bit like an illegal immigrant
That's not even close to him. He's funny. Jerry's funny.
It's nothing like his dad.
Doesn’t sound like you.
It doesn’t like you.
Not like a woman who just killed in self-defense.
Not unlike the business of counterespionage.
This kicks the shit out of kissing!
Like it's not even work.
It doesn’t do that here on earth.
I mean, for someone... You do. Who's trekked across three continents.
So unlike her.
Nowhere near, in fact.
You don’t look a day over 800 years old.
This is like nothing I've ever felt before.
Looks nothing like the place where I found her body,
Well, doesn’t look like me. That's weird.
Unlike me. It's quite a fast flowing current here.
Nothing like flirting over a DB!
It was totally unlike her.
Doesn’t exactly sound like a suicide to me.
Doesn’t exactly fit the prototype of a killer, now does it?
It's not even close. See? I don’t understand.
She doesn’t even look real. She looks like a doll.
It'll never work.
It was nothing like that at all, really.
Not to be mistaken for the elf - hunting camp of a similar name.
No, not even close. Speaking of which,
Unlike the final days of Cybertron.
Not very Superman - like.
Like at all.
This tastes nothing like chicken.
Not at all, sir.
There is no honor.
Hardly seems fair.
That hardly seems right, does it? Your hand don’t look much better.
About that anymore.
But not about what I did!
Johnny had nothing to do with it.
I don’t feel guilty at all.
With an okay voice and no resume,
Not at all weird. Very nice.
That's not ridiculous. Good night.
It doesn’t get there.
There's no excitement, no.
Won’t budge.
Not that shocked.
It's not brave.
The rhymes hobble.
In putting an end to yourself.
Not even fight back? She's not fighting back.
I don’t think your heart's in it, but since you asked.
There's no weirdness, no tension.
Not one inch.
Bend the scenes.
Very not pathetic. Oh! Hey!
That's not so bad, is it?
No pity at all. It pays better.
This isn't cute.
It's not cute. Sorry.
It's not sweet. It's clueless and lazy.
It wasn’t cute! It was racist!
It's totally not ironic.
That's not funny. You made us nervous.
It wasn’t goddamn funny. Look at my shoes.
It's not funny. It's pathetic.
The possibility of murdering someone.
Nothing really fits me.
Not proper.
It doesn’t make any sense. He's a writer. He's got no motive.
I've got no sympathy for you.
Way to not be creepy.
That's not scary, and I'm embarrassed to say it.
No ambiguity or inferences.
Wouldn’t even listen. Being in the, uh... I mean, it was like
That's not attractive at all.
Not exactly peace and love, is it?
It doesn’t make sense.
More like ki - no - NOS.
All rolled out in little coordinates.
Didn’t like anything about it.
No one bit
Then you're right.
Absolutely nothing. And your sweet and sunny disposition.
If you don’t like it at all. - great, let's see.
I don’t like it at all. I can’t find anything.
Doesn’t like Sonny very much.
On top of the worldly wide news building?
Is it so difficult? Look.
I don't. I don’t care.
Living, laughing, fucking? It doesn’t bother you, Tom?
About either of us, so we're just trying to.
He doesn’t care.
Ain’t decent, really, Samson puttin 'the show on tonight
It's not even a particularly trick one.
It wasn’t complicated. I just had to protect the book. That's all.
It's not too many. It's too many!
It's not big.
He's not exaggerating
No heroics. This is strictly recon.
Not wonderful yet.
Doesn’t surprise me.
No wonder you're paying three alimonies.
It's hardly any wonder your prisoners are being murdered
Well, no, it's not. He doesn’t care.
Not at all surprising, you're going to get this little cycle like this
It's not weird, it's perverse.
Wouldn’t surprise me one bit. - with two outs?
No surprise, given how close the planet orbits to its star.
It's no surprise. It's not like I've ever fit in anywhere.
No surprises. A bit predictable.
It's no surprise that Chavez, with the help of an aggressive media coverage
Not surprising, really, because it is a railway hotel.
It makes sense though
It's not weird! Has anyone gotten a bite yet?
Actually, I'm not.
It's no good at all!
Look, it's not fine okay?
Well, I'm not fine, it's all fucked, but.
Not really, no.
It's not okay. They want to kill my babies.
Not even close. You didn’t find him?
Not good at all, sir. But I could've been better.
It's not good. Stop it.
It doesn’t even feel good. It feels like the wet, disgusting, fishy and
No? Okay, let me try and explain.
Not good at all. Hey, you!
Aren’t you a bit curious?
No, it's not. It's the beginning of an I love Lucy episode.
It drives differently.
I am not okay. My husband
It's not okay. Let's go home.
We are not fine! And we're all smooshed!
Not good at all. My daughter is in a facility in Maine.
No, it's not! How am I supposed to get a tree now? I'm made of clay.
It's not great, because now it's here. Isn't it bad enough this thing
I'm not okay. I'm not gonna be able to walk.
Not in the least. Hey, I'll catch you later.
Actually no. I need a favor.
I'm not okay, Jess.
Everything is not all right. Voice mask is still compiling.
No, rocky.
It wasn’t all right, dad.
It wasn’t all right, dad.
Are not funny.
Can’t play games!
Come on, man, this isn't funny,
Is not as much fun as it sounds.
This isn't fuckin 'funny anymore. This isn't funny anymore, man.
It wasn’t fun and definitely not like what you see in the movies.
This ain’t funny anymore, kid! $500 piece of equipment!
Not cool! Not cool at all!
It's not funny. Stop.
It's not funny, you really scared me,
It's not funny, it's dangerous!
It's not funny, mom!
That wasn’t funny. Yeah, it was
No sweat, I always lose.
It's not cool. And my pubes didn’t grow back for, like, two months.
It's not funny. - yeah?
It's not fun, is it?
That's not funny! Yeah. Uh, all right, so
That's not funny, daddy.
That's not funny. You know how much trouble I'd be in if you went splat?
It's not cool, and it hurts.
This isn't funny, Gromit!
Really not all right at all? Why?
Really not all right at all?
Hot sophisticate at all
It ain’t pretty.
Damn, it wasn’t funny.
I don t see what's funny
It's not a joke!
That wasn’t funny,
It's not that funny. It's not that funny.
That's not funny, corporal person.
That's not funny. Yes, it is.
That's not funny. Don't.
You know, you're no fun, but I appreciate your concern.
That's not funny, y 'all.
It's not funny, you two.
That's not funny. You think I'd murder my own underlings like that?
That is not funny, Kyle. You're not a retard, bully.
It's not. Guys, a little respect.
That's really inappropriate. Yeah, I'm going to bed. 'night.
That's not funny at all! That's terrible timing!
That's not funny. - she's got me in a home already.
It's not funny, all right?
It's not funny, OK?
That's not funny. Okay.
It's not funny. That mistake got published.
It's not even funny. Yes, it is.
Lt's not... Funny! No.
It's not funny. - sorry.
This is no laughing matter. No, certainly not.
That's not funny. That's disgusting.
It's not funny. Okay? And I will not stand for this type of blatant
That is not funny. I'm not gonna listen -
It's not funny. I don’t like this Prague con you've cooked up, either.
It's never been funny! I've never done any.
It's not funny. Six hours we had sex.
It's not fun. Let's get out of here.
It's not cute, it's serious.
It's not even a joke! I know.
It's not funny. Oh, I know. I know.
- not funny - yeah kind of funny
I don’t think that's awfully funny, Humphrey.
Not funny, Sid.
It's not funny. It's not.
That's a fucking hoot. Johnny, this is my daughter, baby.
Not funny, dad.
Not a funny joke. And I'll tell you why.
This isn't funny, all right?
That is not funny, sergeant.
Not funny, OK? This is like the 15th present this week.
That's not funny. It's like a gulag water park in here.
You guys are funny. I'm in prison.
It's not perfect. It's bruised.
It's not perfectly fine, you've had it for ages.
This is not okay. This is fatal. It's not fatal, honey. It's realistic.
His is not okay. His is fatal. It's not fatal, honey. It's realistic.
Not at all.
Nothing like Rome.
Not good at all.
That's not effeminate at all.
Not even close. You sure?
Not even a little? Sorry.
There's no viscosity that cause sabcthese currents to dissolve away.
It doesn’t look that safe.
Not as peaceful.
That's not perfect. Huh?
It isn't precious.
Which are impractical, cause lower - back disk compression,
So unkind.
I didn’t feel scared.
And so unafraid to be who they were.
I don’t think that's it, do you, tack?
No respect, man.
That's disrespectful
It's a lack of respect.
I don’t get no respect. This is bullshit.
Wouldn’t respect myself.
No manners anymore. Yeah, you had it down.
It's like you don’t respect authority.
There's nothing small.
It's not small. Three bedrooms and a balcony.
It's not small at all. It looks a bit small.
It's not small at all. Lt looks a bit small
Not a bad haul at all.
Not embarrassing at all.
It's not a coincidence at all.
It's not a coincidence. - I didn’t think it was.
I should say not.
Not at all bad. Well - chosen briefs, I'd say.
Doesn’t suck either, huh?
Not bad at all. As you say, the texture is not appealing particularly.
No, sock, the last thing I need right now
Not at all awesome.
Not lucky at all. The voices are telling me not to risk it.
I am not happy with it at all.
Not too happy at all, merry.
Seriously, that book's got some good questions. You should read it.
Very understated. And I can easily spice it up with.
Not at all, it was fun
It's not sad.
It's off to a bad start.
No, I’m not afraid of that at all.
No? Not at all, huh? Nope. I'm from Brooklyn.
No? Not at all, huh? Nope. I'm from Brooklyn.
Not at all. I've been planed in other dangerous places with them.
It don’t make sense not to be just a little scared.
There's no rush. He's dead.
And not in a sexy way.
Not sexy. We are giving them Las Vegas.
That's not weird.
That's not weird at all. I do it all the time. You know, we don’t usually get people your age here.
That's not weird at all. I do it all the time.
That's not creepy or anything.
Pretty good with heights, huh?
It isn't irritating at all.
Ruined my surprise.
No surprise.
Surprise, surprise.
No what? Or are you serious?
Waltz right out of here unpunished?
I did not at all.
You didn’t think at all, this family will be over if you keep spoiling him!
Not at all. You?
You never wanna go out anymore.
No attempt at all to deny it.
Want to have everything to do with wants nothing to do with me.
And nothing could drag me home.
I don’t want any trouble. You know what I mean?
Wouldn’t want to waste any of that potential.
You don’t want any of that hanging around.
No accident then that a seagoing adventurer
Oh, that's not at all patronizing, is it?
Not the least bit curious? Not one bit.
No dizziness or fainting?
You won’t go a little bit out of your way for me,
No panic, no panic.
She wasn’t upset at all.
Doesn’t know tender loving care.
When they attempted to reassemble it, they panicked.
Doesn’t know anything about choreography,
I - I didn’t know how things got done.
About investigating a murder.
Well, it's not. It's actually no comfort at all.
Not funny. Can’t move.
Not at all. I've been thinking.
Not at all. I felt it was only natural.
I'm not. I was trying to heal them, not turn them into something else.
No, sorry.
That doesn’t rhyme.
That doesn’t sound flirty. Well, not if you say it like that.
Not encouraging.
Did nothing to precludeabc the possibility of time travel,
It's not funny anymore.
The jerky boys aren’t funny, they are awful.
He ain’t funny. He just jealous.
That's not funny, and I'm busy. So if you have any results for me, cough 'em up.
Lt's not funny, Eric.
I can’t ever know for sure.
Not at all. The Renaissance is much better.
Wasn’t new at all.
None of it magic.
It's not boring at all.
Not smart at all.
He didn’t understand any of it.
I don’t understandit at all,
And they got a sick sense of humor.
Not at all, I swear to God.
Not “pinpointy” at all.
And it's none of those things.
Is not a tiny bit of a problem?
About the progress of Jerome morrow.
It wasn’t weird!
Not violent - drug related.
Nothing entertaining about it.
It's not funny! It's never been funny!
Come on, that's not funny, man.
It's not interesting. It's scary!
That's not funny. Oh, come on.
That's not very punk, is it, dad? We'd sound like a folk band.
This isn't great, this sucks.
No. It just shows that she cares for him.
I am not frustrated in the least.
That 's... That's not even close there. - OK
Kills the romance.
I have no idea.
No awareness.
Not exactly warm and cozy.
There doesn’t seem to be much slip.
That's not really encouraging.
About the prospect of me coming home.
No, not so lame - ass.
It's not hot.
It's not hot! It's not hot!
That this whole vandermeyer thing makes me very nervous.
Well, not well at all.
Which wasn’t a whole lot of fun.
It's nothing special at all. Well, I think it's special.
And it wasn’t bold, grey, it was stupid.
It's actually no comfort at all.
It's not sweet at all
That this man got away with murder?
Not mad at the elves at all.
It wasn’t hard at all - not for me.
This should come as no surprise, but he grew up in the psych ward at UCLA.
Don’t worry at all.
Don’t worry about a thing my dear,
Don’t worry out a thing, my dear
There won’t be any time for worrying about infections,
No bother at all, I was just.
No, it's not boring. Deck panels are rad.
That's not crazy. I blame me, too.
No, that doesn’t sound crazy at all.
That wouldn’t crazy
It's not crazy you know. People do this all the time.
No pain at all.
Now this shouldn’t hurt at all
That... Didn’t... Hurt!
No pain at all? No, but less.
The pain has disappeared!
It's not gonna hurt. I just ate. Is this gonna make me.
It's not going to hurt at all.
That didn’t hurt. Don’t be a baby. Yes, it did.
Didn’t hurt! - really?
Didn’t hurt! Really?
Doesn’t hurt at all.
It doesn’t hurt. It's just a game we play.
It doesn’t hurt a bit.
And that didn’t hurt, did it? I don’t want it.
That's not creepy at all.
Nothing convenient about it.
It's not real
It's sick.
Nothing is real. Like this... Me meeting you here.
At all. Really.
She didn’t make any sense. She just kept babbling about.
It's frightening.
Just no idea!
I don’t know nothing about the.
And not have the faintest idea who he is?
No frigging idea how you feel?
At all? It's all right.
A man who is ungrateful.
No, not at all. Roy didn’t say a word.
And see a little piece of who we are, who we may become.
You're not sure?
It's not even scientific.
Mm. Big surprise.
It's anything but stable. Yeah.
Not much squalor.
Is really not quite getting it.
Not stupid.
It's not easy.
It's not so simple, Frank.
Not old for, you know, a man.
Cuts the cold like nothing else.
That didn’t really help, so I saved them up,
It's a little... Poofy.
He doesn’t sound confused.
And buttons aren’t messy.
You're so relaxed. It's no big deal.
There's no strain.
It's not hot at all
You didn’t stammer.
This is not beautiful.
It's not pleasant.
No it isn't... Think!
Not at all, sensei.
Not at all. Why, she's so thin that I can take her little spindly body
Not even a little sex.
Take care of all the details
That is still not comforting.
And nothing less.
No choice at all?
It is not dirty! How rude!
Not to mention my comfort zone. What do you want?
And a good deal less self-important than some people half his rank.
It ain’t natural.
About the dinosaurs becoming instinct.
I'm not comfortable.
This isn't comfortable. I can’t drink like this.
It wasn’t even erotic.
It ain’t crazy.
It isn't absurd, as evidenced by Walt Cummings suicide.
It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
It's not idiotic.
I don’t think that's stupid. I'm glad that I said that.
Even just a little?
You were not doing fine.
Not at all. Ciao.
Don’t worry a bit. Everything's going to be all right.
Don’t even worry about it. Thank you.
Don’t think it's crazy at all.
Not just a little bit?
It's not because I can’t stand this.
He's got no problem with spying on his fellow officers.
And he definitely doesn’t.
It's not flattering at all to you.
Doesn’t surprise me at all.
Didn’t miss it at all.
Which didn’t extend me any more credit, so fuck you.
None whatsoever.
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
I don’t remember her at all. Dad never spoke about her.
You leave nothing out.
It wasn’t exactly poetic, but, um, he definitely got his point across.
Not in a weird way.
You don’t look like one either.
It wasn’t like a light bulb really.
It's not like him.
Not like the emerald Isle at all, at all.
It looks nothing like a tulip. Come on.
No responsibility. It's always somebody else's fault.
They're really cheap.
It doesn’t take much. Here we go.
Hardly worth the effort.
It's no bother at all. Nobody comes by from the old days.
Lt's no bother at all. Nobody comes by from the old days.
Very ordinary
It really, really doesn’t.
That's not soft. That is freaky.
It's not easy, Kaylie.
No, no, I won’t strain myself, dad.
The food's not spicy at all. You can barely taste it.
Not a moment too soon, if you ask me.
I wouldn’t call it awesome either.
Uh, not far at all,
No laws have been broken.
Not sexy. Dump him immediately. Use my cell phone.
Did not suit you.
And it doesn’t agree with me.
Is there any air in here?
But they never show a bit of gratitude
You're not worth her.
It isn't cool.
Not cool!
That's so not cool. God! You scared me.
To the UN - cool? Look around.
This isn't heavy.
None of that matters.
I really don’t care
No importance as in it doesn’t change
That is not attractive.
It's not even sharp.
Fuck, shit, Jesus is right.
It's still the same. Mom.
Not random at all.
There's nothing subtle about that. No, no, she might just think it's a gift.
It wasn’t hard at all.
Nothing difficult really,
Wasn’t that hard, man. You know, you look like a big, metal turtle.
It's not difficult, brother.
It's not hard, one in five.
That doesn’t look so hard; we can do that out back.
Not at all. Anyone can do it. I'm gonna raise you three.
It was not that tough to find ten people
None of it. From any of you.
This isn't gonna work.
No, I'm not. The one who'll pay is here.
Wasn’t very happy. Welcome back.
Is that not noble,
It's not complicated.
No trouble at all, Eva.
No bother. You get me job. You get me apartment, you very good man.
Nothing's too much trouble. Not for you, my love.
It's no bother, little boo - boo. It's the least a chap can do for his filly.
No human decency.
Till there's no air left in your lungs.
Don’t leave any food. She gets hurt if there are any left overs.
Don’t twitch a muscle.
Here. Don’t drink it all.
Waste not.
Doesn’t smell at all.
You can’t move at all?
You can’t move at all? Oh, I can move.
That's not even funny.
That's not gonna help you.
All sorts of bits.
Uh huh. Nothing comes to mind.
Doesn’t matter at all.
It's not even half their fault.
No chance at all.
Nothing at all? - we are doing something.
None whatsoever? No.
Yeah, better than new.
No harm, no foul.
No. Not - not a peep. Why? You?
I'm not worried at all, I'm just.
No bother at all, Mr. Smythe - Willard.
Not at all even.
Not for any of it.
It's not even damaged.
It's not moving.
Didn’t even notice.
Honey, you were great. What?
Didn’t half get picked on.
And he looks the same.
Oh! Nothing ever changes!
Hasn’t changed a bit, huh? Yeah.
Exactly the same. I do not!
Don’t change, does it?
They're not changing, they're light.
Haven’t aged a day.
I saved them all up and then.
No remorse.
She's definitely not sloshed!
At all. Yeah.
Hardly any chunkage.
It's no exaggeration.
No hope at all?
None. Flat. Flat, flat.
He hasn’t scratched it at all.
Haven’t the faintest. Hungry?
And do not at all want to destroy your country.
This is stupid.
Didn’t realize I was getting so
It certainly doesn’t feel like one.
There is no feeling of cheating at all, sir.
Nothing was mentioned of the side effects.
Any sort of indication? In that case, no.
There's no mention of Samantha?
I stayed out of it.
I haven’t changed a thing.
I didn’t even see it coming.
Not '90s at all.
About any of this.... Without a trace.
Anything at all?
Not a single clue.
What is this? That’s not true
Juist a little? No, I write about it every day.
It's not inconvenient at all. Yes, it is.
It's hardly in keeping with the village's rustic aesthetic, is it?
All the way to the bone?
Not at all. In fact, he got in early today.
There's nothing particularly peculiar because it's home.
Never felt a thing. He.
Nothing? Nothing comes from nothing.
Not at all. But I'm in a hurry, my uncle's waiting
Lt's not moving.
At least fantasized about the idea.
Same as always.
I don’t think any!
Absolutely. No, that does not concern us.
None. Cause he eats them all.
How very unkingly of you.
Less than nothing. In - in my family, in - in the world.
Not even partway, she can’t fool me.
And this isn't getting better.
Totally undignified.
Not at all, and I love you, too, but I feel the same way.
Woman: not at all. We're delighted.
None at all. It was a great pleasure.
Not at all. I live over on 110th.
Not at all. I agree with you.
No milk? Not even a drop? I haven’t eaten to produce milk.
There was no fight at all.
Hasn’t changed one bit.
Rather than take a risk on new ideas.
Was not even remotely Japanese. Am I right?
No fashion sense, you know.
The man is not stuck up.
Miller: squeaky clean, every one of them.
Nothing at all? No.
No waste of any kind. You'd expect that.
It's not cute! Do you see what's happening out there?
You didn’t hesitate one time.
No use at all.
It was not magic. A lot of friction.
It's so authentic, you know?
None whatsoever. But it's hard to prove a negative.
And none of them seem dirty at all.
It wasn’t even remotely close. It was really bad.
It doesn’t feel like Thanksgiving.
There was nothing Churchillian about that performance.
My craft ain’t sloppy.
Nothing. liar.
Nothing. Liar.
Nothing at all? Nope, nada, no.
Can’t even fly properly.
That they haven’t noticed
No idea what's happening around them,
Not even warped from the heat.
Without missin 'a beat.
That doesn’t work at all.
Nothing. We suck.
No chemistry at all.
And I've never lost any weight before.
Well, it doesn’t show.
Nothing. Nothing at all?
Not even out of the corner of your eye?
Like no time had gone by.
Never gets old, huh? The other Zack.
I'm no closer to understanding my father's research.
There's not one shot to implicate him.
Nothing like an honest day's work.
But this doesn’t make any sense.
It's dead wrong!
This doesn’t make any sense. She died from an accident.
Not a thing. Why did you pick him up?
Not even a peep. So, what are you up to?
Couldn’t have said it better.
I'm so right.
Oh, I was,
Since you don’t miss anything.
Dang right it is. No, not for you, Dean.
It's all right, Lizzie.
Damn right, it never happened.
You bet your ass, old sport.
It's the literal truth. You're on holy ground.
Ln a good way! Nick dates models?
Exactly. What is our problem?
I can see that. Do we gain miles for this?
That was the idea. I forgot.
I'm right. You know I'm right.
Because you see, I volunteered.
Not a jot. And it wasn’t auto fire or luck.
Very perceptive, captain.
They're entitled. It's the system.
All my life. Well done, very well done indeed.
Nothing wrong with that at all.
It doesn’t even feel good. It feels like the wet, disgusting, fishy and -
No clue.
Not a grain of sentimentality. No, wipe the tears.
I can’t see it from your appearance
Nothing of you at all! Where are you?
You can’t see the ocean at all.
Not at all. What if I turn this one on?
You have no idea what a graph is.
And you can’t describe either of the men?
And it doesn’t make sense.
That makes no sense. You know why?
It doesn’t make any sense. You're the ones that think it's a cop.
Nothing like five - star water pressure.
A little wine won’t kill you.
A little wine, if seized by fit.
Three sips of wine.
A little alcohol, a little water, a little color, a little flavor.
A little alcohol wouldn’t hurt anything, if you know what I mean.
There's no alcohol on your breath. Just gefilte fish curry like always.
One part grain alcohol, a dash of hash, a hint of red bull.
A bit of alcohol actually helps me perform.
He's got no actual control of anything.
Doesn’t weigh anything.

Slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return
Doing anything wrong?
You can’t find a single thing wrong with him.
Without a single wrong note.
A few mistakes, and, uh, I don’t know really.
And some people make a bad choice, That's all. They say life is hard.
There's no margin for error.
There's no way this is happening. Wild Mike. Wild Mike.
A few questions, please.
Never any problems with us.
Not a teeny - weeny bit, as long as you got that.
I can do that.
Perfect!

Not a problem. OK, let's go.

No problem at all, major.
Little collateral damage, but we're back on track with the deal.
A bit of sun, a bit of relaxation, and a huge chunk of Prozac.

A bit of music and a bit of a dance.
We're just having sound problems, listen, I'm ready to collapse,
Nothing's in order. It's chaos.
It all came without warning and in a terribly brutal manner.
There are just a few basic precautions here. Won’t take long.
That was way less chief - y there.
Just a little extra protection.
A few extra things? I thought we agreed.
A little bit of a boost.
Added incentive.
Every little bump
There's n0 breeze. Lt c0uld be any 0ne 0f these tunnels. Take Y0UR pick.
Not a breath of air? No.
You take most of it with a grain of salt.
Any sudden moves can spook him.
Of the current situation.
Not even by rumor?
Don’t worry unless you don’t hear anything.
Not a whisper. CIA, NSA, FBI.
No class at all.
You're just plain rude. Look what a mess I am
I will not even risk it.
Not a morsel will cross my lips.
A little bubbly does sound nice.
A few cigarettes.
You know nothing about the stance
An ounce of chivalry, you'd have given me the master.
Not a damn thing.
Takes more than a little shadow poison to kill me, boy.
A bit of magic, a bit of smoke. Something floating.
A little trouble? That's what you're gonna go with?
I don’t need now is any kind of trouble.
No questions asked,

A Savannah grassland,
It lies in a natural clearing where light can reach the ground.
A piece of sky came down and didn’t crush me.
There it is, Mr. Cui!
I am oozing Garfunkel.
A rave review.
The land of loneliness.
A piece of cosmic shrapnel
One pane unbreakable glass, one standard - issue ring finger.
Peaceful and prosperous.
Is just a valium.
For an ambien.
So what harm could a sleeping pill do?
Calm.
And it's quiet. What's quiet?
It was a perfectly good oak leaf, but without life and without color.
A silent field.
There was silence.

How much he's enjoyed working with you all this time.
Everything that he has done has been to get us here.
A lifetime of encouragement and praise.
He has been tying to meet the president for a while now.
In all this time he's never drawn a logical symbol or a number.
He's been called the drifter.
He's been using me the whole time.
What was he doing all this time?
He's been lying to us the whole time.
The whole time, all of us.He's been watching us.
The whole time, he was lying to me?

All the time, but you do - you're amazing.
Strength and alliances are broken all the time.
All this time, it's been about revenge for you.
All the times you sat at our table. Eating our food. We gave you shelter.
Why you've been helping me all this time?

It's just that you've gotten so used to the fact
And all this time, you didn't say anything!
You always want to keep me with you

So how have you been?
All this time, you pretended to be our friend.

As an errand boy for drug dealers and thieves,
All this time, you never found out who burned you?
All the time I've known you've never once asked about him

Did you know this whole time?
This whole time, you've known how to turn the power back on?
All our lives, you've always known that I was the favorite.
All this time you've known where I was?
I never was good enough for you.
And all this time, you thought you would hate this job.
So all this time, you've let people think.
You've tried to forget the past for so long.
This whole time you've been saying
All of this time, you have said that nobody wanted you,
You're the one who is always telling me to stand up for myself.

The shocking reputation that vampires are having these days.
And the whole nightmare coming, just down the road. - the strange thing is,
The problem which worries all of us.
That's been here since way before the founding of mystic falls
All the while we were growing up.
Faraway, in the villages, when a kid whines.
Suddenly every faith you believe goes away.
For handling things so calmly.

All this time, she thought the problem was her.
She's with me every step of the way,
The whole time. She's the mole.
All this time she knew and I didn't.
And she was very brave about them.
It's so fun, and it's been like the past year of our life every day.
You have a situation in which an informal settlement

Towns make rules all the time.

It's been here all along.
Always has been.
Since always.
Has always been a challenge.
It's been quite a burden.
It's always been just a job. Never been personal.
When all along it is they who are hunted.
All this time it was you.
It was always you?
Was it you all this time?
Before you and all the time your the cat who got the cream.
And you've been taking care of all of us.
You're the one who's always taken care of me.
It was always you and me.

It's always been like that.
This is how it's been
Has demanded the compliance of many countries through force
Which has always been an issue,
For as long as we could.
There's always been that theory
Well, we were having a few problems but, well, we worked them out.
All this time and effort to try and feel nothing,
After all this time.
That I ignored you all that time.
I've had no one.
And nothing happened for so long.
I don't see you for all this time, then five minutes later I find out.
Has not exactly worked for me in the past.
I've always been fairly conservative.
I've been lying to you all this time.
A land cruelly beset by a thousand villains,
Has worked pretty good so far.
And all the while, Satan rages.
And over the Bannister at this ridiculous, agonizing pace.
Always trying to escape.
Occurred under a cloud.
Happen all the time.
Be there till late. Last show gets out at, like ,1:00, plus clean - up.
And that I always will.
Always go for the kill.
With sensitive materials.
And it will be, until you get back in the saddle.
Always had been, so.
All the way to Michael corvin.
Until it hits this access hatch.
Gets it to a level where somebody can make a decision.

He's been living in England
Stayed and took care of our folks when they got old.
She lives on the property.
Lived here all her life.
You lived here all your life?
A tension between those that have always lived there that are poor,
When I visit Venice, and if it's not available,
Who has always stood beside me as my friend and colleague -
Always the soldier, on the battle fields of the South Pacific, Korea.
He was a long - time loser: petty theft, Assaults, drug charges - but no kidnapping, no sex crimes.
Always. You're really drunk.
All that time you were planning on running again.
You always felt like that? Yeah, always.

Keep your back to the car at all times.
They keep the best records
Right along there just like that.
And hold them there.
We're also watching for her ins and outs.
And save that for after the 2:30 meeting.
All the while having her secret plan to get me to get her pregnant again.
Trusted me, mentored me.
All the way down to the cranial base.
Always looking down upon us, and always judging us,
Struggled with addiction to crack cocaine.
Tried to protect his stepdaughter
And he's been befriending all of us.
All of this pretending to be by my side
To be a part of that family all summer, and I'm not.
Worked on him, worked on him, but.

Always, like a son.
That I felt at the wheel of that pedal car.
All the time like this. And what's with the lips?
Just keep doing it like that.
That hugs my body like a horny ghost.
Pump it up until you feel the pressure.
It's all lady power all the time.
Simple joy of walking side by side with your buddy out in the fresh air.
It's been on a trickle charge.
Always do my best. When I do my best, it's creating it.
Just shy of your 80th birthday.
Keep an eye on 'em?
Watch it at all times, and plan its future.

And I still can't eat them to today.

Until this morning. Went to the gurney, it was empty.
Lasting until the wee hours of the morning,

And waking up there Christmas morning, like you used to.
Until... Until the fight at the bar.
About 25 or 30 meters below the ground.
All the way to the floor?
To the grave.
All the way downtown? It's not so very far.
All walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time.
I've been trying t0 find y0u

Fly all the way to Hawaii and bomb?
All the way to Cheyenne.

Straight to the brain.
Spun my wheels into my late 20s.
Since becoming "America's next top model"
To get around the law until I'm 16.
I didn't have a steady girlfriend until I was 20.
At least until I learned the truth.
Until I saw the story on the news.
Until we decided that we hated each other.
Until we won't want or have anything!
To the moment we came back here.

Before we pass it to the D.A.
To "we didn't start the fire.
And eventually we're gonna get to a spot where the world ends.
Until we make the arrest.
I didn't open it until I got to work.
Till I heard the gun go off.

All the way back to the very beginning.
And it is only very recently that it has been possible to come and see the gorillas.
All the way up to something   like about 75, 80 degrees
Got away with it, too, till a student discovered his fiance on a slab.
Until someone decided to hide weapons in it.
Up until "here comes the bride." Then it's all a bit of a blur.
Everything up until the killing will be a gas.
Everything up until the killing will be a gas.

Everyone has an ability?
As long as I'm still breathing.
Forever, ever, until ever

The mural that normally resides here is called the spirit of Pawnee,
Has been killing for a long time.
All through the night
Conducting a series of classified experiments.
Have taken spirit walks.
We're always looking for something new.
By a squirrel.
coming after me
Following us, and I was - we was thinking.
Since the day I left the Academy.
Hunted down war criminals,
For the last three months.
Made of smoke that's hunting him down.
Chasing after other people's asses, you bastards!
Has been tracking illegal activity in our databases.
Before I got into the green machine.
Look... Always running away.
Have been sitting on that neighborhood. One call would have told you.
Was in there whole time arguing. So y 'all didn't get nothing?
Until the early '90s, when his mother passed on,
Hearing the same story over and over again.
And just hovered there staring at me.
Instead of going off into a pet?!
Somebody there, somebody that's family,
I was there until 2:00.
Reading of the treasurer's report.
Was that there the whole time?
And just talking, talking, talking, talking.
Just walking, walking.
They must be in there.
Have maintenance go down there.
Checking out the Swiss miss,
What's always been there.
The darkness that's always been there,
He talks about it all the time.
That I was waiting for her in the bar? - she did.
Just keeps repeating the same word.
That revolves around itself and feeds upon itself, ends up
Just keeps repeating the same thing over and over again.
All it plays is this.
It just keeps switching back on!
Keep it cooking in the pot
Looking for love in all the wrong places.
It's always by the door.
Blinking auburn diamond, which you ignored.
Asking, why was all this happening to me?
I keep asking him,
Keep asking them questions, just.
All the time. Basically, we lied to her.
Kept asking where she was.
She kept asking if we'd talked about the, uh, ski trip.
Kept coming to me for suggestions about what she might want.
"Where's daddy? "All of her life. You know?
You keep asking me that question. My answer doesn't change.
Asking just what love is
To be with him for all the minutes of his life.
Like he's hiding in plain sight.
Are keeping all kinds of secrets.
In this minivan waving around his wife beater.
She's forever adrift, can't find any rest.
I fly this route all the time.
Hasn't stopped swearing since.
Has been harassing her and her family.
You've been bothering the Admiral and his family.
It's what's always in the dark.
Has been preaching heresy.
You're always preaching the same things about loyalty and brotherhood,
"Always "made it worse.
All... The way down to the basement.
Sitting smack dab in the center of a child's fantasy world.
It's totally selfish to wait at home, frustrated,
My entire career on the bench
And sat by the lake, that's all.
Too much sitting around waiting.
I've been sitting outside waiting for you.
You keep going by on a train,
Just sitting and sitting and sitting.
We're just gonna sit in here until you crap your pants again.
Father and I had been insisting all along was true.
That we hold so dear.
Clung to the property until he defaulted on the mortgage
You stuck to your guns. That's right. You're the integrity candidate.
And we hung in there and, of course, won the super bowl.
It took a lot of sweat and pain and perseverance,
So sit through their meetings.
All the way to the hospital.
All the way to the hospital. Buddy, you saved her life.
Holding on to tomorrow
 - keep holding - holding
Had always believed in helping others,
By saying no constantly and consistently, you empower yourself
Has always maintained his innocence, I know.
Down his back.
Oozing down to her stomach.
That goes all the way down to my waist
that goes all the way down to my waist
Buried him up to his neck.
Buried him up to his neck
In that courthouse.
Is it always based on a traditional tune or melody or is it sometimes
It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank!
All the way to the top. Exactly. All the way to the top.
And it just keeps going and out at the end they're predicting a little bit of fall off but one doesn't know.
That is up to the - almost current, and here is again the latest census Bureau thing from -
Always claimed they couldn't find him.
In an ongoing game of one - upmanship
have had a bit of a quarrel and now it's being healed in some measure.
Get rid of your barrier
In constant danger.
Ever since I took you under my wing.
The afterthought in Chicago jurisprudence.
Deep REM sleep from which he cannot wake.
Through the ringer.
In a severely depressed and near catatonic state.
You know, consistency top of the tree.
Live in a perpetual war zone.
Hit rock bottom.
And just sort of waiting in second position
Always on the edge of danger, always chasing a faster time.
Since the birth of our solar system.
At all times, right in front of our eyes.
Has always been on a need to know basis.
it's - you know, you're always in pain,
Yelling and yelling till I grabbed his throat.
He shouted all the time.
Bawling all the time, never sleeping.
Rain has been coming down in buckets but, at least for the moment, has subsided.
Stick your hand in and bluntly dissect down until you feel two tube - like structures.
About everything, and now this?
From his clutches and ran towards the door.
Being gone all the time.
 run the straight race
All the time, Olivia! That's who he is!
Always wondered who that was.
Yes, it did. No way.
All of my life.
All the same.
Always? - always.
Always? No. No, sometimes.
They always do, right?
Always been, always will be.
Threw it back there myself. All the time, back there.
I always have, ever since I was a kid.
All the time. In every conversation.
It's always been this way? Always.
You always have to be on. Otherwise, why would they like me?
All the time. She ever call you a chair?
All the time. Good to be you then.
Always, mom.
I always have been and I always will be.
Always have been, always will be.
Always. Your Lord father, ask him.
Always have. I thought I could get over it to work here.
Always. I thought of you.
Never could. I'm the youngest
All the time. Now don't move.
It's true, till now.
All the time. Amazing. People are stupid.
As it always was... And always will be.
Always do. - that's what I want to hear.
I'm afraid that I'll keep compromising
With his interstellar communications system.
The clatter of the idea
It's always there, even if you can't see it,
Indefinitely?
It's between Tricia Skilken and Haley Graham.
Always present.
There have been a number of other changes that we know to be important
There has always been dangers of brain damage.
There would have been this tension, and this lack of confidence,
She keeps it forever.
Native Americans with longstanding territory disputes.
Was stored in a moist, dark space.
He vacations in people's lives,
I've been lonely for so long
Stand by your man.
Next to your highly - endowed and beautiful sister
I want a guard on him at all times.
Have been making good on this contract.
Who preached the virtues of Nanbu samurai.
Always maintained his innocence. What else is new?
She claims lo be my wife.
Just bear with me.
Mrs. Collins, the woman he was staying with, wanted him to have these.
We have him under observation.
To look out for him.
Got eyes on him,
I followed him around.
I've always... Had... Some feelings for you.
Of holding something back,
Has a very belle - positive platform,
To write the thing in the first place.
Have been telling people that he wasn't a good worker and he can't be trusted.
Being aware of my surroundings as l am,
I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others
Any knowledge of her fate.
Being patient with me.
She was trying to swing her hand at me,
Constantly telling me how to do my job.
Keeps telling me.
You've always been so good.
Who have never been completely on board with the current agenda.
Are always pointing the opposite directions?
Stay at the microphone until I bore them to death.
Keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
Been telling myself that for so long that I started to believe it.
I've always been interested
Keep searching.
The happiness I seek
All the way to the floor.
Through and through to the throat. She wasn't stabilized.
Keep shooting it!
Retains him on the walls because she believes in the slogan "safety first".
Always will be.
That just keeps holding me down
Dragged across state lines.
Always getting pinched.
I was very discreet.
Trying.
Trying to re-establish contact with you and Oliver.
Always the curious one, yeah?
There have only ever been two kinds:
Always just phone calls?
Have been hiding just below the surface.
Has been here the whole time
Who has been farming in Canada.
It's been right in front of us the whole time.
Right under our noses the whole time.
It was right in front of me the whole time. I didn't see it.
Was right under silly's nose all the time.
He was always running some scam,
It's been sitting here for two years, ever since.
It was right here the whole time.
It's always been there.
They've been lying since forever.
Has always been here   and will always be here.
When I was a grownup.
It was there all the time. The usual.
Has always been a key driver of human progress.
It's always been him.
It was you all along.
It's been you all along, Hasn't it?
It was your parrot the whole time.
It always has been a magnet for the worst of humanity.
She was always there for me
Always the bridesmaid.
The same boring thing since day one.
It's always where I'm standing.
It always was. How's that?
And there has always been, and always will be.. The same percentage of winners and losers
This is what it's all about: pitcher versus batter.
Always looks like it does now, always has the same average density,
Had the whole "angry, pink hair thing" going on.
It's always hard.
It appears that someone's but an entire village over it.
It had to have been there. Nobody's touched it.
I've been looking forward to this meeting.
And I never got a chance to thank you properly.
We've never been off of it.
Never did get it running.
Never leaves his side.
It was right in front of me the whole time.
Are they always this bad?
It just keeps on repeating over and over. Ye yes, it's a recurring expression.
I mean, he completed training. I think he's over at 94.
Just the way it is?
Is that how this is gonna work?
Is always like that. Is from bad circulation. You know that.
Does anything possible to keep his hands clean.
Being such a loving friend.
And so it remains gasping
It's been owned by a small developer
Till the bank foreclosed.
For thousands of years. And you are a stark.
I try to stay working.
Worked until 1:00 in the morning. You can check.
Right up until the day we left.
We've been working every day since. What are you looking for?
For working late into the night.
It worked fine.
All the time? I said shut up!
That I was dying to share with somebody.
L always wanted to work with an artist that natural to himself.
Always hoping he'll make a commitment.
Always hoped that I'd be an apostle
From decade to decade, holding on to the one hope
It would have been pretty sweet to have any one of them owing me favors.
Hoping some scout might find me?
All the way to the state finals at long branch.
At all times.
On you the whole time?
Been carrying it around with me.
I'll be sick.
A pocket watch with him, right?
She was wearing your ring.
Keep this with you at all times.
Kept taking me places that weren't in the brochure.
Just keep running with the child?
The dark glasses go on.
And I've been fortunate in my friends.
It's always been lucky for me.
The whole time, she seemed like she was about to cry.
To keep getting your stupid butt out of trouble.
I help people all the time.
Help them until they realize.
That was going to cover my back all those years.
Has taken deliveries to the U.S.
Who raised my daughter amemiko for me.
Always gotten me out of trouble.
And going.
Twenty - seven straight hours at that grill.
Running an operation like this, undetected for so long.
And into the early morning.
Stranded the other day.
Doing this?
Varied from competent, good.
Always & forever.
Always and evermore
It was supposed to be until.
It's been empty since.
It's been unoccupied ever since.
All the way across to the far side of the world
All through the rocks.
All the way through here.
Put him on the driver's side of the radio car.
Where it meets the sea along the coast of South Africa
Is it all the way down to the larynx?
To the shores of the Mediterranean.
Down the concrete walls to the foundations.
Form horizon to horizon
To the crossing near Tabriz.
Reaching all the way to the vault of heaven.
Stretching to the horizon.
Which leads to her office.
Headed right towards the vanishing point.
All the way to the tail,
Crops all the way to the base of those mountains?
Leading to the universe   that we see around us today.
At the base of my right shoe.
To the army recruiting office.
Extending all the way to the lonely tower of Philip the fair, which marked the beginning of France.
And desert canyons to artificial landscapes.
Stretching to the borders of Europe
Encompassing nine levels directly below it.
All the way to the river.
Until it rises above the waves,
And extend far under the sea.
And radiate up to your neck?
And they lead straight to the museum of natural history.
Under the oil wells off the North East of Scotland.
For this stepping stone.
Which leads to the park Monceau
Across to Siberia in the west.
Down there all the way, and.
There's a blood trail going into the building!
Yeah, all the way down the hall.
That runs from Patagonia to Alaska.
It stretches back about three years. There's even a timeline.
Until they reach the shores of the mighty Pacific!
Were placed on back order until now.
That is until India broke off and began to migrate North.
Has continued through to the present day.
And remains a leading city in Christendom today.
And continuing up into surprisingly modern times, people still lived very badly.
And go all the way to the front door.
And lasted for the rest of Greek history.
Until the day he stopped wishing he sounded like anyone else
As old as time itself.
Till we find an open bridge or ferry, then we're gonna cross the Hudson.
Drive down the block.
We could just keep going and going.
And keep on driving until he told me to stop. And I did that.
Drove all this way, you gotta do something.
Go straight. No, Lola says take a right.
And then we went straight for about maybe 20 minutes
It's washed out at the end. Call us when you get there.
Straight here. You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.
Just keep driving. What are you doing?
Keep driving a taxi, starve, shit on my kids' future to keep writing?
don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.
Continue straight until you reach pier 15.
This should get us back to the highway.
And I'm just gonna drive until I see the sun.
All the way to the airport, huh? You know, that's over 30 miles.
And the whole bloody engine ends up lying on the pavement.
Out to Frenchman airfield from here?
And you drive on down to the fuel docks at Bay front park.
All the way to Chicago?
To keep it open until so late?
Back there into here
That's as far as you go!
Head down towards bank. Have that.
Directly to Worsley road.
To the cabin.
Just keep heading towards the city.
Keep moving, sweetheart!
Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here.
All the way down. Yeah, yeah.
Straight ahead. Turn left.
And go through the drive through.
Keep driving! Go on!
And live happily for all eternity.
Please keep going. Fast.
Keep firing everything you've got!
Go ahead and hop on the freeway... Zero to 60 in eight seconds. Let's see.
Keeps the heat on.
Keep the line open.
All the way up. We'll make it cold, like winter used to be.
Keep this live. I'll be listening in the whole time.
Keep this door open or you die!
Keep the music on, and hang tight.
Just keep driving. I'll tell you when to turn.
Him around the block till he fell asleep.
Stay your course. - turn!
Just keep driving! Run the red light! Drive! don't shoot me, man! That's all I got!
All the while
I keep trying to figure out
In winning year after year. Of course.
And the same six numbers kept popping up.
Play it until l fall asleep.
Always had a healthy curiosity.
It's kind of funny that you would place a lot of emphasis on a law that says that nothing changes.
He keeps saying he's okay. You must be very proud of him.
All the way. Of course.
As their own personal graveyard going on two decades.
Were put to rest almost three decades ago.
It's pulling to one side.
All of the above.
I kept going up, up,
And worked your way to the top.
Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go.
All the way up here.
It goes all the way up and.
Just under
It goes deep, deep, deep, deep, and they come up.
Go, go down.
Okay. All the way down!
Go down into the basement.
Work our way East.
Ride East. Your sister's waiting for you.
Keep going uptown.
Why he kept running over to your house.
And away we'd go.
Step on it, will you?
Ls it straight on? Yes.
Straight down the road, about 50 miles.
Keep driving straight.
Keep on going and you'll see a big Zelkova tree.
Go straight past the coniferous spruce.
Just keep swimming, just keep swimming
There's a river, 250m straight ahead, go.
And keep going
Down the hall.
Keep moving, keep your head down,
Walk till you find a lamp.
Just keep walking, don't look back. Go, go.
You keep moving.It's the only way to stay alive.
Just keep moving forward, people.
Go ahead. Have a nice day.
Let's just keep walking forward.
Yeah, you walk straight ahead.
Just go straight! Straight!
Continue going straight, I will tell you when to turn.
Just keep walking. I'll explain everything.
Go ahead, take it. It's on the house.
Just going to go straight and then we're going to make a right.
Walk straight till you see.
You're going all the way up. Thanks. Great.
Right at the bridge and then just keep going way down there.
You're gonna walk straight ahead. Go.
Go straight ahead and there's a park.
Keep on running and don't look back. - okay.
Keep on running and don't look back. Okay.
I hiked North,
Just keep on going.
Keep on this path North. I'll be back when I got him.
I say we drive South as far as the fuel takes us
Keep going to the right.
Stay right. You can't miss it.
All of these images were negatives,
There's no stopping it.
And keeps looking back at Leandro.
Straight back. Last door.
Just head to the bridge.
Just stay to the left. You'll be fine.
Into the part of my brain
Gets me here every time.
Against a telephone pole
Still moving southwest. Southwest.
Go ahead that way.
All the way over here, Mt. Melbourne. Twice as far and the opposite direction.
Through there.
Force it in until he can bear no more.
Guard: straight on through.
All the way in the back, all the way in the back.
Just down the hall. Thanks.
We can stay there until next Tuesday. And I have the perfect camping spot.
And stay UIL you deliver the baby.
On the East side until closing.
Get myself straight for Sunday morning.
When until dawn,
And stay till it gets dark.
And stay until you deliver the baby.
Until we built out Mosul.
Stay there till I return.
And stay there until I tell you to leave?
I stayed until the end.
Then stay till graduation. Okay
Just until I can figure a few things out.
Covering the same place gets us in a rut.
Stay in the right lane and don't go above 20.
I went home and I stayed home. You didn't tell your wife?
The group session.
For the past seven years.
He was always out and about.
Stay right here until we can get somewhere better.
For good, huh?
While you turninto an old fossil.
You must be tired staying here this late.
Spent all his time there.
I want you to stay there
Until power comes back. Great.
And you're staying on the road until I see profit.
The whole entire time, and meanwhile my aunt was remodeling her house,
It never gets any easier.
Was very unhappy, very angry.
Always professional.
Always glad to see me, aren't you, fellas?
Always the optimist.
It's always messy, primarily because of you.
Always good, just never good enough.
About his new job,
I've really been working hard.
Always sweet.
With this investigation.
More all the time.
I had the biggest crush on him.
Liked playing doctor so much,
Always loved fire.
Always liked the place.
The world's ass for centuries
That's been bothering you. Right?
Always have.
Generous with her time and talents.
I've been okay.
Always, darling.
Top - shelf all the way.
I've always been curious to try.
So far so good, no problems, no birth defects,
I'm always alone.
You know, it's been real quiet and I haven't seen anyone by here
It's been really quiet. L haven't seen anybody down here.
It's been easy, until now.
I always am.
It has been carefully planned, we will surprise everyone.
It's been busy.
You been keeping busy? Uh, quite busy,
I've been busy. Did you find what you were looking for?
always in a hurry. You're lovely.
DOM was still pissed and
I always miss you.
As a member of the professional media.
I've been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.
Been expecting you.
I'm always thankful for your care.
Always worried.
Always about the work.
In the recent past.
He's very driven.
I've really been looking forward to singing for you all,
Been looking forward to this, sir. Yes, I know.
Was dying to meet Blaine.
There's been a complication. The target's still in play.
He's always an ass, but he's very rarely just wrong.
Always special.
For a masquerade ball.
I'm in pain all the time.
And is it constant or does it come and go?
About what to do regarding his vision.
At all times, did he not?
Important to us.
doesn't get any easier.
It's always tough, huh?
It's just hard to believe this is actually my life.
It's never easy to say.
Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies.
And never getting a chance.
Always looking over your shoulder.
To a home where there was constant care.
It's on repeat. It'll stay on till we get home.
Keep smiling?
Keep smiling, keep shining
Stood right up and talked to her.
And bided my time until I could get out of there, which
And I never forgot them.
Just haven't gotten around to getting rid of it yet.
I've been a little busy with the trial.
Keep earning money.
Laboring to finish.
Been too busy saving the world from bad guys.
Too busy whoring around and getting fucked up now.
I've been so busy meeting people. I even got invited to parties this weekend.
Been busy losing your virginity then?
He was too busy practicing surgery on his chicken
It's been a good friend
All the time? No, but.
Always happy and smiling.
Run it fast forward.
Until he died.
In your sleep last night?
Ignoring me.
There's an ongoing hostility.
They fought me the whole way, but in the end I was right.
Doing what?
Through with what?
Always hated them.
Before he was shot.
And the guilt of what I've done
She's been suffering from chronic depression.
Pending and unresolved.
This was never adjudicated.
And being worked up all the time never got anyone pregnant.
Continuing to punish me is fine.
I've been waiting for a moment alone to take a closer look at the photo
Always wanted, but found out I couldn't.
Trying to figure out how they came up short.
Can't stop thinking.
I keep thinking why is the dopa at 17 and not 20,
All the time, my beloved.
All the time and I always will.
I've always wanted to live by the sea.
That's all I do.
All. The. Time.
Thinking of you always, Robert.
Rushed for this whole thing to happen.
I tried to be a gracious person
All of the little things that I never had time for.
You know, have sex all the time?
She tried to be a copywriter but got turned down.
Always wanted to get "tron" ed.
To check it out more anyway.
Always wanted to be in that kind of book. Oh, misery manuals.
Keep thinking I'm gonna go someplace more authentic,
I kept meaning to come to new York and visit.
Always wanted 'em! But my mom never made' em.
Been dreaming of burgers. Hey.
Like I wanna throw up all the time.
Always wanted to, but I found out I couldn't.
We can finally do all the things we always said we wanted to do if we lived alone.
Thinking that she actually meant it,
I've been wanting to talk. Me too.
Wondering if maybe if the gun hadn't been there.
It's always been on the list.
Been wanting to do for days.
Always wanted to build a log cabin.
I always wanted to be an engineer.
Still trying to get the baby.
He'd been trying to fix it quietly
Has been barking up my tree.
Going to bring her back.
He keeps coming to us for more money.
Think of me all the time. I think of you.
And I was thinking how long since I'd looked at you.
Always wanted me to have a child
L `ve been trying to call my wife. Would you stop touching me?
Over the part of me that wants to kick your ass all the time. Whoa. What's going on here?
For a chance at redeeming myself,
I was hoping I'd have a chance to talk to you.
Desperately trying to find some type of way to apologize.
I've been trying to find the right time to tell you. I can't believe this.
Who want a big power struggle trying to squeeze him out.
Tried to claw her eyes out.
I've been meaning to give this back to you.
Kept trying to pull you back. You just kept saying, "let me go."
I've really been meaning to get off my chest!
Keep meaning to changed it, but it's a lot of paperwork.
L want us to be close again.
When I was thinking about how to improve my relationship with him,
Always trying to save their own people.
Always wanted a cucumber to call my very own.
Want to put on a good show
And I always wanted to see the falls.
And always wanted to destroy?
Always wanted to use one to light a cigar.
Been wondering what that looks like.
Always wanted to see them.
~ and I keep thinking... ~
Thinking he got away with treating me like crap.
 all the t - I - I - IME
Dreaming of you.
All the while knowing that there's a paint pellet out there with your Namen it.
It was always, like, Nepal or Uganda.
To be thinking about sex
And I... I've been thinking about our futures
Knowing I could have been with her?
With your suicidal tendencies to notice. What?
Always thinking I'd get another chance to do them.
Always think of the now. No time to look back, no time to say how.
Keep new York in your head and work hard.
Keep thinking I'm gonna go someplace more authentic, you know, like Portland.
Actually, I wanted to apologize.
Constantly trying to please. She judges herself harsher than anyone.
I kept thinking about this ghost.
Always wondered why you never cut more of my songs.
And I've always wondered if I'm any good.
To play tennis for nine years,
Been meaning to call you.
Trying to come up with a story.
Kept asking, though.
Always wanted one of my own.
Always wanted one.
 all the more for that
Really? "Always"?
Have been meaning to tell you, um.
Telling us this entire time.
Always wanted to. I hear it's amazing.
To keep going back up to medical
Who keep trying to kill me.
We've always said a change would be nice.
Wants to meet you.
Is trying to drive you away, and - and it's not because.
I was hoping I'd run into you.
You should be looking at.
I was wondering about you. So lovely to see you.
I always wanted him to take me.
And trying to put back in prison for good.
Always wanted you to have this for the right girl.
Was trying to get her to move on with her life,
Always wanted to try one.
Always wanted to test - drive a Lamborghini.
You really wanted to get out,
She keeps asking me to join her.
I've been meaning to say thank you.
Always wanting to go away.
I've been meaning to introduce you to.
Always wanted to say that.
Kept meaning to walk in.
One question never got answered.
I've been wanting to ask you something.
I've been meaning to ask you have you lost some weight?
Always "means before the killings, the arrest, the trial.
You felt my pain, too?
Always be grateful.

On the wagon until today, I guess.
And you keep doing battle until you are finished with it, and it is finished with you.
He never stood to ease his breast with panting.
Just until you make good on your promise.

At all times.
Always pretending to be somebody else.
It's not healthy to keep a hat on all the time.
Had masks on the whole time?
Has been looking forward to in months. Well, so what's the problem?
You can count them on the fingers of one hand, my good woman.
How can a hand move by itself?

The cab didn't show and I had to wait cos I was on the bike.
Keep trying to reach him on his mobile.
I won't stop until he kills me.
Kept calling your cell phone, there was no answer.
Until judgment day and trumpets sound?
Beat him till he was in his mama's kitchen.
All the way in the middle of the parking lot?
All the way to the river.
Would the expression "keep on shooting until you run out of ammunition
Over and over till your arm weakens?
Sources, Martin they told me you've been in retirement
So keep it going. Stay in it.
Four tight whacks, no food or water till she came to her senses
You punched her in the face until she bled.
All the time. Atta boy. Atta boy. Atta boy.

I'm really sorry to keep imposing on you.
He kept interrupting everybody,
She kept calling the radio,

You've been looking for something.
And has suffered alone ever since.
And suffering and then death.
Been making a mess,
If you keep getting them
Before they popped him twice in the head?
I was towing him into shore.
I always regarded him as my older brother.
It's dragging you down.
The fuck he kept you around all this time.
Keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times.
And try to delay it until the pay restraint.
Thread it up to his coronary artery,
Push the straw down to the root beer at the bottom,
keeping me on tenterhooks till the last moment. Why?
And kept backing me in a corner, like I was the one who was cheating.
And drank himself to death.
All this time you've been hiding this beautiful woman from us?
Are putting their money into developing drugs that treat symptoms.
Kept just missing him.
Citing something about their high expectations.
I can't hold on forever
To shut up about it.
Until about the day he retired, at age 33.
But we get to keep shooting until one of us misses.
So they kept getting discounted, so they don't make any difference.
Like gnaw, gnaw. Why? Why didn't he?
They've been gnawing away at me.
Moving my hand on him in his pants.
And plugs into so many outlets,
Of all that is great and righteous.
I felt guilty for years.
A false reading, so my car wouldn't start.
Always complaining.
They complained the entire time.
Have you spoken with regret for having journeyed with us?

All the way to the pyramid.
It was a difficult time.
By going to the end of the deck you're always going to undo
I have been retained to represent Joe Carroll.
Always worrying about something
And the idea that he would find her.
Part of me always worried about what became of him.
Always afraid he'd get into trouble with his temper,

And finish at that point
Keep going, keep going.Keep going.
Been able to keep hanging on.
Pull through to cheek,
He was repeatedly rejected by the fire department.
And I always refused his money
Have refused to confirm or deny the rumors.
We put it off until today. Then we couldn't do anything.
Was really not shaped until well into the post-production process.
It trailed all over the floor.
I did not arrive here until 4:00 in the morning.
With a long extension cord.
And then it travels all the way.
Hold out until the girls are gone.
To there.

For nagging you about Angela.
All the way to the car.
You carry it until we get on the plane, OK?
You've been shooting sparks at my top hat, laughing at me all along.

Not too tired, holding the camera?
I keep picking up this wretched card.
For the rest of my life.
Works with that kind of thing all the time.
It goes on for 21 days.
It keeps on going.

For 11 consecutive nights.
For more than 40 years,
It was like that for maybe six weeks or so.

Until three nights ago.
Through the final years of George's reign.
Which lasted to the day he died.
And they don't stop until it's sold.
Until the evening shadow fell,
It went on and on into the night.
It continued after she left.
And It's just going to go on and on until we stop pretending
And fondle you right through my coffee.
Right on through Tuesday
Slept right through her graduation.
It goes till dawn.
And it's still going on.
As long as it lasts.
For how long? Forever.

Just keep pressing n, we want to keep those missiles on the ground.
And ring it and ring it and ring it until they answer.
They're obligated to protocols. Make it personal.
And massage your heart back to life with his bare hands.
Push it till they come in here.
Keep pressure on it. We'll be right back.
Look, keep constant pressure on this wound, okay?

Stick the bust out.
Channel surf?
Rides right into the sea.
I'm losing my hair. I'm fat and repulsive.
And I'm gonna squeeze until it breaks.
It stretches out the door and around the block.
As far as the eye can see, and then there's a cliff and the ocean.
As it plunges into the depths of the glacier.
Nothing yet.
As anything other than a test of our ingenuity and our endurance,
subject continues to retreat emotionally.
And make out until finals are over?

Till the moment that you had to get in your car and drive here and tell me about it?
He kept on touching, at last he tore my dress.
Keep playing it until he tells us what we want to know.

Hasn't come back to the office and is out there with him.
Has not been answering my pages,
And you've had no word of her?
This whole have no kids thing
I didn't get your RSVP.
Not realizing that we're a part of it
It was never found.
They never found his body.
They never found his body.
Never found the doer.
The fack that I never found a body didn't surprise me.
Why you haven't been able to find the Pissarro.
Nothing ever did till now.
Never caught 'em?
Never caught the guy. Well, that's why I want you
Never properly set.
Never happened.
I let it hang on and
But nothing seemed to work - apparently until now
Things haven't been working out.
Really haven't been able to connect with anybody.
I haven't had the pleasure.
L didn't have the chance to be seen by you.
And I didn't get the chance.
See you, or
There's been a democracy deficit.
It's never really healed.
Hiding any sign that he intimidates you.
Never been recovered.
And leave it at that.
And still I have not been informed of these networks.
Nothing at all. /// thank you.
No car's came by.
We couldn't nail him.
haven't got around to it.
Never got the chance... Aah!
Just haven't had a chance to turn them in yet. Yeah, right.
Never had the chance to fight for them.
To tell him, without his lessons,
Never got the chance to tell her.
Never really had a chance to talk.
Uh, we... We didn't get a chance to finish talking the other day.
I never got to say, uh,
haven't had a chance to say I'm glad you came back.
I never really got to thank you for, uh,
I never got a chance to tell you, I'm deeply sorry about your wife.
I still haven't had a chance to talk to my dad.
didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
We really didn't get a chance to talk after what happened yesterday.
Since the night of the murders. - Tony rush.
Up to the handle?
Never found who did it.
I was beginning to think you'd lost my number.
White wine, never really seen the point of it.
I could not see him.
Never really had that growing up.
You haven't slept?
And I'm not sleeping well.
haven't gotten any sleep.
But we've always been missing him, so here they are, yummy stuff.
Never left your seat.
didn't leave at all? No.
Never had a chance to go.
Never did get around to changing your name, did you?
And never got around to paying the guy.
Never been married, happy as a clam.
The suspense is just killing me. What's the surprise?
Been out of touch.
I never told her.
I could never get him to break it.
Then you haven't married anyone and you'd say
That was never recovered.
They never found them.
haven't seen you since the... Formal.
I haven't seen him.
No dad in the picture for some time.
I have never lived with my dad!
It never came down.
Have been breaking the first 2 rules of fight club.
Practicing with you, but we have plenty of time.
Began and ended at Hadrian's wall.
It runs right down to the water.
Keep going in that direction.
What? Just carry on down the road?
This young man who's had his eye on you
From the fact that you're driving my car pretty recklessly.
I drown myself in that sanitizer stuff,
See me.
He who has watched her will then appear
And we kept looking at the river.
All the way down the elbows, the whole deal.
And ever!
Living until the present.
Who survives until the present time.
Living with the guilt of what he did.
Use yourself up living on memories.
You will always live in fear.
I have been riding in the shadows of the reputation of the famous double board certified redhead.
To live a complete lie.
So long as you live in the past, you'll never find your future.
He has been.
All this time under the conditions that he's been living
It's really out of date, you know.
Which is used till today
Heading out into that direction.
Tunneling straight down through the Greenland ice
Down these stairs to the cellar
- breaks East - west. - what house is to get it first?
Never regained a pulse.
Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin
Way beyond my lip line, so I wouldn't want 'em anyhow.
Entering into the cranial cavity.
Down to the bone in his extremities.
Just keep breathing,
Keep breathing.
Keep breathing. There you go.
Are still buried deep right here!
I've always loved her.
I always have. Always will.
And you kept on loving her.
I slept right through to the following afternoon.
I always knew after all these years
And swing it from Virginia
Yes, drown the sky
Is it drown the sky?
It percolates down into the mountain, and then collects down under the hills.
And looking to go straight,
And he got that kick - ass stereo he wanted.
Very anxious to meet you again.
All the way through to the island.
Yeah, keep swimming to the other side.
And out into the open sea.
So swim until you can't see land
Got to swim all the way out, retrieve the key, and get back.
All the way up.
The man would not shut up!
Roll like a log till you can't no more
To your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it,
To the creek bed here.
By the time he hit 'm' street, he broke his neck.
Dripped down onto the carpet.
Like a tick.
The real reason of her cousin staying away.
Uh, through 14.
Packing 'em in till the small hours.
Of condoning tyrannical governments.
Have been living as sleepers in American and British cities.
An unlimited potential for Post-historic man.
Fire in the hole.
To rot until the next millennium.
Drunk and incoherent?
It burnt for three days straight.
As long as you keep the light on its eyes, it won't submerge.
Keep the beam on the compass.
Everything you're doing for him.
Always looked out for his baby sister, comes home every month to help us look for her.
Looking after his family,
And comfort him until an ambulance arrives.
Until he's all grown up.
To look after you.
School today and have her till morning?
Provided for me, loved me, I believe,
Taking care of her?
It burns and burns
All the way up the flagpole?
And I always will.
Always loving you, always saying yes.
They've been hot and heavy ever since.
And he always had.
Loving me until you die?
I always have and always will.
I always loved him.
Loves his family.
And I always will. But I never tried to woo her for myself.
That he loves us.
Oh, continue to love me. Never misjudge.
And it ended up here on my chest.
The muscle ended up in your chest? Right. Ended up here.
A special rescue squad
At the craps table, and we wanted to reward you.
Who keeps yelling from the balcony.
And keep on biting so hard, till I'd bleed sometimes.
Giving enough blood to put the red cross out of business.
And playing and playing and playing.
And still play a poker game that our daddies' daddies started 50 years ago?
Play along, make believe that this does not piss me off.
We won't be back before it's Christmas day
And we played till dark.
We won't be back before it's new year's day
Until somebody loses a testicle!
Where people don't leave till the next day.
Rode him to level four.
When the neighbors called the cops on us.
At a card game until dawn.
You handle him too much, he's not gonna last.
Always took good care of him.
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard to stay angry
Holding on to anger just eats you up inside.
Living in a funeral home all your life - maybe things got mixed up, huh?
We have always lived here.
Growing all the way to the tops of the peaks.
Lasted until Jubal died.
Which I still use to this day.
Keep the pressure keep the pressure... On the trigger.
Keep pushing! Okay, I see its head.
The last couple of days.
With the old English thing, OK?
During the revolutionary war days.
Just smacking that flint over and over again with a machete, and nothing.
Always using an I. S. I.
Scrubbing them with a Brillo pad.
He was licking me with his eye the whole time.
Bang their head against the problem
He had his knee on my head the whole time.
Use to make my own arrows!
Always on his own passport.
Always in the past tense
Keep taking it in through the nose,
And constantly tormenting yourself with the latest tornado updates is not gonna get us there any faster.
You're welcome, by the way.
Making all the decisions for you,
And you left it on until his heart burst.
Drawing Smurfs until ninth grade.
Till tomorrow.
You have until third moon.
Just to go live in a convent.
Just been fucking with my mind, you know?
I haven't been the best at sticking around,
In some kind of bubble to protect them but I know we can't.
And remain there until I bring you word.
It'll stay there, until... Until it's rescued.
The past few months?
It's been kept.
Kept it all this time?
Always. They're noted in the files and sent to legal.
I was saving it.
I'm totally paranoid all the time.
Till, like, 8:00 a. M.
Is that she was sick my entire childhood until she died,
Yeah, it's moving down into my back.
That goes from here to the back of my neck.
I have to live like this.
To use their business as camouflage.
Always. Your your mom is visiting from new York.
Still, I honestly believe, if she was looking down on us now.
Wondered about.
All the frowning and the one - word answers.
Watching us all the time?
Watching us the whole time to see what's going on.
It's always been there, but it started to get worse
Just now has been watching me pee pee, really.
Do not let him out of your sight.
He's staring at you.
Cow eyes the whole time. Guys, seat goes right here.
The one that's been staring at you.
I'm sorry if you bother, but your face look familiar sir.
Watching her and coming into her house in the middle of the night.
He just - he just stared at me.
My boss at the show
Looking at me
Stare at it until it disappears?
Keep looking at it
Staring at that word, "unless
Spent a lot of hours looking at that, wanting more.
Kept gazing at doors for you to come back.
Oh, being unable to see.
always... And never.
Always... And never.
When your voice and mine become one and whole.
 always believe in...
Go on believing that her daughter ran away
 that there would be another chance
Always believe in love
Continue to trust your heart, and your dreams will follow.
Without incident.
Stay in love.
Wanted to see you dead.
All the time waiting for your pal, Jesus, to save her.
Keep looking at him. If you had any heart at all, you'd be stealing for a living.
She's been watching you on TV.
I've been seeing things again.
Down into the heart?
Watching TV all day, we're taking him out of here.
He made me watch!
Never leaving his eyes. Never leaving his eyes.
That keep looking at you.
Just keep your eye on the horizon. I'll get you some ginger ale.
Keep Looking towards the sky, the secret to it is to keep away from hate.
I kept watching, wishing for the rain to stop
I kept staring at the sky... It became darker and darker
Watching her scratch her ear.
All the time. And you are just the crab to do it.
Just keep looking at it. don't stop looking!
And I watched till it burned black.
Keep looking in his eyes!
And look at me all the time
don't stop looking at me.
Through the hidden cameras all the time.
Looking straight at us. Hmm, not sure it likes us.
Keep looking at me. Alright?
Was always looking my way, but never came over.
Keep looking at me. Keep looking at me.
Actually from the pitchers hand all the way in to the catchers glove.
You follow the ball right into here. You see that? Okay?
You know, looking out at the audience. That's a
Watching the kids, and, well, it is a school.
He's exhausted from reading that bill. I got woozy from just carrying it.
He kept watching the clock.
Reading stories about bad people he believed deserve to die.
When I was a little boy.
Constantly? Really?
Fortune didn't smile upon them.
I keep glancing over.
Keep your eyes open.
Keep your eye open. Keep your eye open, Steve - o!
For 14 hours straight.
Sleep till I can sleep no more. And then
I haven't been sleeping so well.
I slept till about 11:00 or so.
Till you turn 18?
Sleep till morning light.
That you're sleeping till now? Shut up and get out.
Waiting for your turn.
Keeps sleeping?
Until she goes to the store.
Keeps it a secret until.
What isn't he telling us?
Way before she let me in. All right.
You knew!
The whole time? No. Not the whole time.
It was always gonna end this way.
Always knew you would. Right? didn't I always say that?
I always knew you were lazy, but I didn't realize
I feel heat.
I knew something was wrong with me.
Working on the same thing over and over until they get it right.
Scientists have been drawn to one of the greatest mysteries
Just bang, bang, bang up his ass.
Hard enough to draw blood.
Always getting in the way.
Praying to God the whole time,
Far from your side.
Until it was stolen from him late in his career.
Always wearing the same clothes
Always dresses nice.
It's always the shoes.
And wearing all the time
All the way across the sea.
Right through to the research farm behind me.
All the way past molasses swamp and I win.
Breathing down your neck the whole time.
All the way up by your head and I won't look at anything
That you'll stand by me forever
The way you stood up for me
Standing by me. I know it Hasn't been easy.
Right up front in the front line of defense against Tai lung up front.
has been much attached to the mobs
Of standing around the sidelines like this, you know?
To defend himself to the end.
He just stood there, staring.
Standing,
Standing by and waiting at your back door
Has been doing whatever it takes
Has been doing whatever it takes to keep the river thriving.
When she was conscious.
Kept laughing saying nothing. Your tooth are extremely clean.
For the rest of your days here on earth？
Giggle till it hurts
A smile every now and then wouldn't kill you.
Waiting, waiting.
And waiting.
And I waited, and he never come home.
 be so alone
For as long as I can.
Until you came home too loaded to go to his banquet.
Wait for the fire to die. Take him. He'll lead you to the northern lights.
Wait till they do, indeed.
Until he goes away to college.
Wait till he finds what I left in his birdbath.
Until him and his boys get up here.
Wait until he is in full back swing with the wood
I wait until he has a break, some kind of break in his schedule.
And waiting until you was 1 8 so that l could see you.
Just wait till you get home?
When you finally came in.
 wait till you're locked in my embrace
Until you knew that you belonged with us.
 wait till your charms are right
Wait till you see what I can do with the fog.
Wait until, uh.
 wait till our lips have met
Wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.
Until the person goes away?
Waiting until Andy was ready to be a father.
And wait till it's empty.
Wait until it's empty then get the papers proving who I am.
Let's wait till we get back, then we'll tell everything to the MPs.
The road ended when my husband passed away.
 wait till I hold you near
Till my case is unsolvable? - you got a girl that's dead.
Until my eyes were adjusted to the dark.
won't be so steady come morning.
And not return there till spring.
He waited for his kill shot.
Times it to the last second.
Waiting until the body is discovered
Wait till somebody comes out.
Laid low till the cleaning crew left, then had.
To wait until just before the dustmen arrive.
Waited until it was dark.
Wait till they see us.
They will wait for their one true love.
We kept waiting until 4pm the next day
Until this boat is at sea?
 wait till the warm - up's underway
Waiting for this hell to be over.
Or wait until the anger passes？
 wait till you see that sunshiny day
Waiting for the day that the prophecy might be fulfilled,
I waited for the diner to empty.
And hanging around for awhile and then popping out,
I'll wait.
 I will be waiting
Keeps waiting for publishers to reply.
And I'll wait long enough
Who's been waiting for a big break all his life.
Waiting on parents that will never come back.
You've been waiting for this.
Waiting for the day when you will help bring an end to the tyranny of the gods.
So that one day I could place this call.
And just waiting till I was 18,
Just waiting for a chance to use.
Laid low till the cleaning crew left.
It's been waiting for him.
Always waiting for you.
Always waiting for you, Toyoji, and you never come.
Yeah, I was hoping you'd stop by.
All this time how could you not know
Saving herself for you, dude?
It's been here waiting for you.
Wait till you see this space.
Waiting for her magic doctor to return,
Always waiting for someone to ask for her hand
That have been waiting for us
Waiting for me all this time.
Keep waiting for me, it's your turn now
And waited until such a time as he did spot her heading for the laundromat.
Yeah, prior to the arrival of the mother ship,
Been waiting for the day
And waited. That was a year ago?
Waiting until you were old enough to get on the show.
Kept waiting for it to get harder, but
And proceed to steal historical relics until you're caught, right?
keeping score.
To take your side.
At April's Halloween party.
Always, man.
Right on his heels.
And repopulate the bald eagle species,
This constant obsession with needing to know
And they never stop.
Who won't leave you alone?
Over analyze whether it was makeup sex or congratulations sex.
All this time, it's been right here in front of me.
Ah, till I'm hitting 85%.
Practicing until sunset?
Every single moment till the match. - all right. All right.
wheelchair - bound Yoo - Yeon, who has no feelings in her legs,
He stayed in orbit around the moon and never landed.
Who's been feeding them rat casserole
Is keep feeding him pain killers,
Who has to keep giving him all the bad news.
His conspiracy theory
I even give you some rice, and you still complain!
I've been calling you.
The psycho who was making obscene calls?
And I have been cleaning up your messes and doing your care taking for fucking ever,
The one who keeps showing you pictures of her grandchildren?
Who's the man who always brings you flowers?
Who's been surprising everybody,
Kept bringing her meat.
Kept on sending her weird, freaky food - fixated messages.
If you keep buying your kids crap like this,
Pumped up the word until it exploded
Two things that always give us great joy.
Wrote all the time.
Been calling my office, looking to shake me down.
Keep recording me?
That keeps calling my publicist.
Glue your eyeballs to them till I get there.
Glue your eyeballs to them till I get there.
And it keeps going on.
From time to time.
For generations to come.
Since its formation.
Stretching far across the slopes of Mount perdition.
Keep blossoming until it shows its entire glory and beauty.
That's haunting her right now, don't you think?
Insists on bugging me about the tab for today.
That haunts me to this day.
Always on you.
That haunts you and drives you.
I keep having them, and they're terrible.
I've been protecting you.
don't l always have your back?
Stay gorgeous.
All the way to the back, the end of revelations,
Taking out the files - studying them over and over
When you're in protective custody the whole time.
To stop thinking about it.
Keep cracking wise, pal. It's a good way to make friends.
I've been patiently waiting here.
The river's oyster beds for the last four years.
My ears are ringing.
They talk all the time.
Till 2:00 in the morning.
Talked all the way till they closed the place.
And we just talked and talked.
Chatting away like they were old pals.
Oh, you've been out of the loop, so I can't expect you to know this,
I mean, without any of us knowing... Doing this the whole time?
She had a string of bad debts.
Straight down 10, maybe 15 feet.
Down, down over her knees.
I've been kept occupied. - so I hear.
He carries that with him.
Keep asking myself, did I push him too far,
To getting American companies to help combat this.
Worked to make this peace agreement a reality.
Been working for many years on how to design replacement parts
A couple of days, we came to an island,
And sail to San Francisco
You know, one that sticks with you, doesn't let you rest?
In search of a home
I'll stay open.
But known thee with all of my heart.
Enjoying your time riding my behind?
Up into the hills and even into the mountains around Zurich,
In your basement the whole time.
Being stuck in your own psyche.
Used to hide in it all the time.
Hung onto it.
The whole way? Yeah, the whole way.
In some damn vent, agent Pierce.
She's always tired, ain't that right, baby?
He's been keeping a low profile since.
Has been much attached to the mobs.
Where he's apparently been living quietly until tonight.
Keep acting like something you want is gonna happen
To be slipping.
With the ghost of your disappointment
Have always been very well protected
Kept down by the man.
I've been a freak.
His mother control him so much he acts like a servant.
He was obsessed with his old farmhouse.
That has always known
You're always pretending is your boyfriend?
In the penitentiary. Cuff him.
Below decks in the ship's brig.
And badgered at every turn.
Were kept under control.
Something primal.
I was stuck inside for so long... Right?
Underestimated by kings and leaders.
Such a long time in such a mess
Unit 7, which has been unjustly attacked by the media,
And happy and loved.
Who has been held up to you.
Being released from stars,  including our sun.
Losers, who get beaten down all the time.
Who is constantly being turned down for a date.
Was cuffed up the whole time.
Was always taught
And then bored and finally, bored again
aren't you tired of swimming in gossip girl's fishbowl?
It's used as an insecticide,
It has long been known to relieve pain, such as that in your leg,
Have been repressed and controlled by men.
Kept getting distracted by the boys.
I've always been stared at. I want to walk.
A constant symbol of the plains
Who has been detained at
Entrance and exit into some kind of sky world.
Has always been sacrosanct.
It was formerly believed
Had always been considered to be a tall tale.
Long considered a Jane Doe,
Has been described as the most wired country in Europe.
Was considered off of the beaten track of standard science.
Caves, long dismissed as dark and lifeless deserts,
And has always been blamed for Australia's draughts.
Who had been called into question in this University
Just being around this all the time.
It's just been weighing on me a bit.
And it's shaped by wind, it's shaped by waves.
Been haunted by it ever since.
Fake it till you make it.
Then pretending our "friends" will be back from the "bathroom" soon
It takes a lot out of you - acting all the time.
It hurt to hold a smile.
It's when it creeps into its third century
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Until passing through the event horizon
Just hold out until I've completely finished.
Still be herein the morning.
You keep trying to bring him down.
Is pulling me away.
It would be hours and hours of interrogation
How you manage to still ruin my life.
Since we moved in together, and you refused.
Asking for more conflict in the series.
Demanding we release him. What's happened out there?
Until I go away from London, it's not safe for you to go out.
Got drug tested all the time. If I smoked weed, I'd be off the team.
Across its toes to its tail.
Keep seeing her face and how hard it's gonna be.
Biding his time,
Observe her until then.
They had been watching the battle and
I'm minding my own business, okay?
Have been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
I've been insecure and... Dishonest.
I've been having diarrhea.
I've often felt like an outsider - never really fitting in,
I always knew you'd be a beauty.
Always felt that you were fully repressed living
Insisted I was cheating on him with anyone,
Who said I could do it all alone
Have been feeling very insecure.
Thinks anyone who talks like this must have ganja to sell.
Was always a temporary assignment.
Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting.
All your warnings about me sleeping with my boss,
And I've been planning on coming here. But.
One of the 2 American spaceships
One of the 2 American spaceships believed until now to have disintegrated in orbit,
Always knew that the princess' soul would return,
Kept thinking, I could never live without you by my side
Have always regarded the British people as completely horrible.
All my life. He's my brother.
Never liked us.
That never fails to amaze the world.
To inspire and provoke twenty - four centuries later.
What's the point in keeping him here like that after all this time?
You've been leaning on your whole life.
Makes you think, doesn't it?
I'm sorry we keep asking you to treat us.
Developing my skills as a people person.
Suspend her until she gets serious about this.
You had us all so worried.
And I haven't stopped since.
Hanging up on us.
Being at home with Anthony,
Asking me to do - draw a map.
Where you keep me doing things for you, hoping I'll slip up?
Breathing exercises all the way to school.
Keeps me working.
To let me keep doing that, I'm going to be okay.
He kept asking me to marry him, but I said.
it's - it' s - it's - it's haunted me.
To keep me high the whole time.
It spiraled and.
With the sort of physical contact
Can't get them out of my mind
What has always fascinated me most
keeping me alive, eh?
You kept me talking.
Messed me up real good, man.
And it's a point of honor with me.
To get this fire going
And kept training and kept it up, right?
Right up till the day before the launch.
I did my training, I deserve.
But always remember,
Always remember I am nothing.
Always remember I am fear.
Always remember I am filth.
Always remember I am hunter.
Remembered her all this time.
Keeps going on about hell and purgatory.
Hasn't shown any improvement
Keep trying till I get their attention.
Try to surprise him, and he would always, always, always say.
I've been trying to bury.
In an attempt to conquer the holy land;
To kill the peace treaty from the start.
Always probing.
Am trying to come to terms with my guilt, because
Kept saying how everything stank.
Gabbing all the time, won't let nobody get a word in edgewise.
I shop for bathing suits I never buy.
Talking a whole bunch of shit
Just kept saying he killed her. How? How did he kill her?
Talking all big about his ship coming in.
Always telling us how much he loved us.
Kept claiming his dentist killed him.
Been talking about how he's gonna smoke the bitch.
They were just like, "you did so good.
All the way to long Island.
Kept hearing about this headstone. Wanted to see it for ourselves.
And the expiration date on shit like that is fight night.
She keeps talking about you until late at night.
Keep repeating that. You feel threatened.
They said that?
Keep talking, keep talking, keep talking. Stay focused.
He just kept going and talking and talking.
All that time, mostly saying, "he'll be back.
He kept saying she was the one.
How long have we been saying we were going to.
Kept saying he loved her.
He kept saying "matzah taco.
But enough of me. What about you?
You kept saying, "I want to come home, mom.
They tell me! That I'm seeing things.
Also claims that they were alone all night, claims that he doesn't own a gun,
He just keeps saying, "please.
Kept saying: one year and I'm outta here, one year.
For the past four days?
And you, go on and on and on about grieving relatives,
Going on about being followed, people trying to kill him. Crazy stuff.
That they were gonna help me,
Says he's my boyfriend.
He kept saying he would destroy us.
He kept talking about trading places with you.
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.
The one who keeps talking is yen Zizhun
Be talking about him.
Always talking about you. - really?
Been reading your books, I have a positive attitude.
Working leads that went nowhere.
Went all the way back to 1995
Went all the way back to 1995 and there's really nothing there.
No, talking about it just makes it harder, so
We talked until after 11:00.
She's talking about half the time anyway.
Talking about God and forgiveness, all kinds of crazy shit.
Charge to bring him news of you,
Has been running an investigation?
Blaming me this whole year? Is because.
Blamed herself for not acting sooner.

Have been telling people that he wasn't a good worker
He followed her to the park.
Thirteen years of sex with the same man can be a little bit boring, all right?
Has been following me around,
Are telling girls that they have to be thinner.
And we've spent our lives together
To keep booking appointments.
And kept on telling me all the reasons why we should hire her and

It does the inside cupboards no good at all.
Behind the monitor forever.
And sticking to their blind spots.
I've been hiding in my garage.
Due to unresolved childhood issues.
Stay hidden until I come back.
Of hiding out these days.
And had eluded authorities for that long.
That must have eluded Alex.
And running from cursed creatures?!
Six weeks towards the end, but it was worth it.
She kept lying on the tatami mat
Contemplating the difficult nature of his new existence.
I'm bored. All I do is lay around.
Just spin and spin.
Around the top and come back on the bottom.
And don't stop spinning until you're dizzy

To run statistical probability scenarios
Stayed friends.
Had an unsettled concern.
He kept chipping away at it,
Keep pushing, we'll get a whiff of the money, too.
Oh, all this sneaking around is driving me crazy.
Isn't she, though?
To continue for a couple of hours.
Driving mile after mile after.
Always. Why? I thought that we could get a drink and catch up.
Be pounding on your leg the whole time,
And keeping him here, it's only making it harder on everyone.
And it goes on and on and on.
So the reasoning continues backwards.
As loyal as ever? Yes, sir.
It's rude to stare, you know.
doesn't it hurt, smiling like that all the time?
Just all the time.
All the time. - mm.
That was the plan. - you were flying the plane. How could you have killed him?
For all these years.
I'm tired from all this walking.
Just keep saying it over and over again until it sticks.
Just keep telling me that.
Always did.
He always did,
In making the arrangement permanent.
Like, forever?
And live with this. It may not be "the" justice, but it's "some" justice.
Keep trying to breathe for you.
Always, man. Always.

For them, you know. Yesterday that one was in my underwear drawer.
For hundreds of thousands of years.
Always, sir.

Permanent.
And it'll go on 'til the end of time.
Again quickly.
All the time. - all the time
I can't afford to keep it, either.
All the time. I stole it from her.
All this jumping and fighting.
You know, all the time. I'm sorry, but I wasn't raised that way.
This constant pushing is not helping your cause.
It's not OK to keep doing like this
Always. There was an empty tape box. Then there's obviously another tape.
Keep feeding me like that, I'll lose my girlish figure.
Keep it up, pretty soon it's not gonna hurt at all.
Right up until the day of the election.
It's amazing that I'm lasting through it.
Waiting around is making me crazy.
Is it always low?
Practice with these.

For over a year now.
Going after her all the way that way.
And went in right after him.
Follow this story right to the end.
The camera guy that was following him
To the root of all evil - me.
And kept pursuing them, waiting for them to slip up.
Always chasing a faster time. Not me.
Of what it is that you're going for.
Back to the dark ages.
Up until four months before I was born.
Dating back to my first pediatrician.
Back to the source.
I would chase it until I couldn't chase it anymore.
Chasing after madam and young master
Chases the demon and the girl.
What do you mean you don't stop?
Back to his father's office.
Chasing after that first plane.
Asking about me.
To walk in his footsteps.
Where you go, I go.

Consistently crushing it, I know.
Kept on beating you down,
Been under a lot of pressure. Just let me relax.

Kept me coming to my meetings, kept me working my steps.
It just keeps going, "please try again, good - bye.

Before we started to feel something more.
It has only ever been you.

It's always gonna be like this, isn't it?
It's always there, isn't it? Even in the dictionary.
It is been kept going, whether you are selling cars, or whether you are marketing computers.
It has always been so. The reason is obvious.
Have you always been like that?
Been that way ever since ever, l guess.
Oh, I always do. - hmm.
It continues in that vein.
So is it always like this? I don't know.

Since always. We were all going, but at least now
It happens all the time. I'm sorry.
Always the same thing.
All the time. Now that's true.
It's the way it's always been, man.
Has it always been like this?
I do it all the time. I'm so used to it. People wash their sheets all the time.
That's the way it's always been. Whatever.
Been forever since I'd known a holiday,
It's like a constant thing. I mean, since we've come to France
Has it always been like that, or did something happen?
It's always been the same. Of course it's Myung - ho.

This has always been the problem.
Is that what the blind man's been teaching you?
After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?
Always those damn rats.
Always with that same geek look.
Been that way my whole life.
That's the way it's always been.
It's detective Rizzoli, officer Rizzoli,
It's been wrong.
Okay. The question that's bothering me the most is.
Negative all the way.
And look forward and be, like, "I gotta think about this before I do it" instead of just go for it.

And it's been smooth all the way.
Always was, always has been. "How did you know that?
She's just better.
She had always been perfect.
I was up all night
Always locked?
Locked and secured at all times.
Stays locked in her room.
Not to bring that up.
I can't remember you not being around,
I'm just taking whatever it is
This whole purple heart thing.
Brilliant until the end.
Thanks to credit cards.
It was always just me and the chocolate, me and the food.
Booked her time religiously, but she never once showed up to play.
Always sticky. No problem.
I've never had the guts.
And you've been drinking.

I was wide awake.
Awake... W - with you operating on my heart. I
And keep repeating it.
He keeps repeating,
Over and over,
It appears again and again.
Able to keep repeating the same argument over and over again.
I mean, repeating high school over and over.
They keep showing the same thing over and over and over.
Will be the first of many happy anniversaries
All the repeating the ends of the lines?
In different languages, over and over again.
And building and building and you sold the story.
To keep a lock on me.
Something's up. That is proper lockdown.
I'm always the mistake.
The kind that never grows up.
Way up into the clouds.
It goes all the way around his head. - I know, he was so cute.
Which grows down into the ovary
Until they were the size of an acorn
Until they have grown as much as they need.
Has been developing at a rapid rate.
It's flickering. It's really annoying.
Glide and flicker until dawn.
Just glistening at the top of the
 go on shining
Shut up and hold on. I'll be fine.
Keep them closed.
Now, keep your eyes closed. Okay.
Fire away, chief Holland.
Asking all those questions about my background, my health.
All that asking questions about how you are and how's your day?
Kept asking me why I wanted
Kept asking me why I wanted to join a family with so many secrets.
And he kept asking me if you were ever coming back,
He was always asking me for that black book.
And check with them if we're doing it right.
Kept asking if he could deliver the passports himself. I should have known.
Keeps asking about his dad. Worried school started without him.
Keep asking whoppers like that, we're gonna be here for a while.
All these questions. This is beginning to sound like an interview.
Spending a lot of time in her room.
It went to the supreme court. You know what they told her?
Always smelled like grilled cheese.
His evil spirit keeps following me
I'm the one that should have been there.
With him, as always, his coach and father, sergeant Pete Daytona, of the us Marines.
That kids can be there for their parents.
The one person who's always been at my side.
That will be with us... Always.
At least until someone better comes along.
You know, who stuck by you through all this.
With me!
And she talked to me until the sun came up.
As long as it takes.
And stayed with him.
You kept company with.
Every step of the way. You can't ignore it.
In a way her parents couldn't be.
I'm playing with Sayuri
Came with me just to keep me company.
Who was always there, and now I'm completely alone.
So, you keep going, hoping one of the gambles comes off.
Wondering if I would be coming back or not.
Been carrying it around with me. Waiting for the right moment, I guess.
Keep that with you at all times.
When she came to this country after the war.
From her superiors for more than 10 years.
By our keeping the alpha phenomenon secret,
All the while, they keep it hidden
For the last couple of days, I hope you'll understand.
A silver-back male.
A snow rose. No.
Have been very popular in Europe and South America for years.
Has always treated me with the utmost respect... With loyalty.
Has been highly effective.
Right there. That's right.
The only thing I've ever gotten paid for is being pretty.
You have made a living watching others.
Towards the sea and your back therefore.
Being a little too vulnerable.
All while living under the threat
And our reservations are good for another week,
Came strong and kept it coming.
All the way from highway 10? Yes. I wear chanteuse.
 keep on lifting
All the way to the yellow sun of the earth.
Fought my way to the rendezvous and here we are.
Approaching Mongolia.
I'm just achy and tired from all the travel,
And straight on 'til morning.
Stationed without incident at camp Pendleton until last night.
Call him names. Run him down all the time.
And kept speaking evil of me.
Ride off into the sunset? Live happily ever after?
Every second of the day.
All this lying about where I've been.
And he says that a wolf is attacking his sheep. - yes.
And you're lying to me now.
She kept calling.
Who has been pleased to take unto thyself the soul of this thy servant,
And a parrot flew down and landed on his shoulder and said,
Been nothing but trouble since.
Until the end of semester.
haven't said a word.
That has guarded the temple for centuries
have had the courage to fight poverty.
Trust me, he's got fangs.
Speak for yourself.
What does it look like? It's a mock - up.
It's easy to identify one person
It just knocks me out.
Those look like our men. - you think this plan will really work?
And he definitely looks guilty!
His mouth betrays his words
You obviously don't have satellite or cable, sir. Up to 200 channels.
You look like you don't belong here, and you definitely don't belong under the car.
You ought to get you a hat that says "undercover cop".
You obviously haven't partied with pharmaceutical reps.
You just look like you can move.
I could tell you were spoilt.
Looking at you I could tell that it was the first time for you.
I can tell that you're a thief!
You are the handsome one.
One look and I know you're an Aquarius you're as beautiful as a flower
Whoever stole the mattress also broke that award
You CAH tell from the big breasts
Looks exactly like a kept woman
She totally fits the part of a murderer.
You see a picture of your son,
Can you see? See what?
Who would kill you as soon as look at you.
Once things were evened up, she pulled me off of him.
You'll start stutter if you only see him.
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks,
I see that man, I get an immediate urge to wind him up.
Now, when you see him, just point him out to me, okay?
As soon as you see him, take him.
I knew he was the one the moment I saw him.
You see him, you call me.
He makes me pissed off.
And every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
As soon as I saw him, I took off.
I see that coming, and I'm out the door.
Breaking my heart, watching him punch the air like he thinks it's gonna punch back.
Call the second you see his pickup. Let it ring once.
Would run at the fearful sight of his horse hooves.
His heart will stop at the very sight of you
His heart will stop at the very sight of you or he doesn't deserve to live.
And as soon as you came forward like this, I thought Oh, here we go.
Ah, I see you two have a book open there,
So when you see your mama.
Bite you as soon as look at you, those savages! Bite you?
At the sight of you can say sorry
Probably gotta watch your figure, your line of work.
You are a sight for sore eyes.
I am sick once seeing you.
I always want to play when I see you.
When I look at you, I see everything I've ever wanted.
I knew it that moment I saw you, you were special.
I see you and start defending myself.
On seeing you, I felt you had come with some purpose in mind.
I look at you, and I feel nauseous.
Seeing you gave me such a turn.
As soon as I saw your team.
But as soon as I looked into your eyes, I knew.
We see some movement, we just keep firing till he's dead.
You see any vampires, you shoot to kill.
It's the first thing people see whenever they look at us together.
Just seeing the stuff in the shop window makes me
I get hiccups when I meet a girl I like
As soon as he saw the reporter, he started bashing him
I never could stand the sight
One look at her, people just fell in love.
You let me know as soon as they come
You gotta walk up to the hottest thing in a place; otherwise, you're finished.
And is jealous of her son,
As soon as she saw her she said,
I see her holding a dead moose,
When I look at her it breaks my heart.
Her, I think she was frigid
See I look at them now and I think what I said to you. It's your job.
Just seeing it gives you an idea.
Now every time I look at me, I think of you.
When it comes to you, how can I forget?
There was that whiny thing in the short skirt,
Saw it, fell in love with it, bought it on sight.
I recognized you immediately.
Feel dizzy once you see handsome guys?
First sign of trouble, you give that coyote howl.
And as soon as I saw what we had, I was so happy.
They crossed the street when I approached,
They got me away from my post just long enough
When I give the signal, do it.
I look at my wife, my son, and I.
Get out every time we see a bulldozer?
Little spring flowers with blue in them that come up first.
Whenever you see a ship, you run down quick.
Once we saw that blood, we knew you'd be showing up.
When they're looking at a beautiful girl.
As soon as we see the submarine, we alert the guard station over there.
His little face just lights up with joy.
You see an opening,
So, one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits
That Butler always gave me the shivers.
And once I saw the word "arson," I freaked.
They see a chance to jump ahead of you,
Every time I see Sasha, I feel like we betrayed him.
Show me a skirt, and my brain simply whirls.
Started reading this file,
One look at this jewelry box, the empress will think we have the real Anastasia.
Since I see this beautiful beach,
One look at these man - boobs and I was in, huh?
You know, it makes you sad, it makes you.
I saw this color and thought of you.
It all clicked when I saw the implant.
Now, as soon as I saw those dilated pupils, I knew that could only mean one thing,
I knew that the minute I saw this shit hole.
Not when there's money involved.
As soon as I saw their dog, I knew something was wrong.
But eyes reveal a wife gone fucking mad!
The right sleeve of an Internet porn addict,
When l see hearty eaters, l want to cook.
ain't never thought about being a model till they walked into the audition,
Pretty sure she's a lesbian.
Soon as I opened that letter, it went right into my briefcase.
Who is obviously not your doctor?
You didn't knit this.
Not a pleasant specimen.
Perfect typecasting, they could be Buchenwald guards.
You just seemed special.
It's not, like, all trained and perfect.
A magic bloody mystery tour by the way it's decked out.
He's bulky, kind of heavy - set.
Like he'd seen things, bad things.
Off to the gaming tables.
She's a keeper. Hang on to her.
Made me sick just to look at it.
I can see.
Makes good reading.
Or a boat on a wall for 11 years,
Of course she is.
Was never answerable to the bottom line.
You'd make one hell of a target.
That self-lacerating crap reeks of her.
He 's, uh, apparently fond of wrought iron.
Is the same as my high school?
It's got Takeda's stamp all over it.
Off the wall false.
It's totally fake - looking.
The baby is clearly Mexican! So, you know, the swirl is out.
Ah, the smell of a genius.
This is her handiwork, her latest triumph.
Must be good stuff.
Sure have a great pitcher's hands.
This was it.
I mean, you're obviously hung over.
Typical landlubbers. Aye, no stamina these days.
God and country for all to see. Am I about right?
Drop off the grid crazy - guy style. I like that.
It's got the mill creek 'SM. O. All over it.
Rookie move.
Cuts quite an athletic figure.
Appears to be a close - range.
All consistent with mauling.
Mercenaries, by the look of it.
Not - significant is a big word.
He wasn't planning no sea voyage.
She must be important.
That figures.
Entirely different kind of chinks.
He doesn't look sincere.
Knew he had to be taking something for his cholesterol.
Can't you tell？
You can tell just by looking.
You'll figure it out.
Well, it's no secret how they got in.
It's the type, sweetie.
That brought to mind the happy hippos in fantasia.
You can see he Hasn't
He won't do it. I can see it in his eyes. He won't kill me.
To know it when I see it.
didn't believe you the first time.
No mistake in what you're in the mood tonight, is there?
It's pretty obvious you guys are together.
You must be a new around here, ah?
You look like the friends. You do. - hi.
It didn't look like nothing.
Looks like you're dressed for business.
Like you're wearing my clothes.
I think I can tell who wrapped that.
You can already tell which brother - who is this beautiful woman?
That's easy, boss
Sure he's not done military service owing to his Filthy rich father.
Oh, yeah. You just know she likes it dirty.
She's a total skank, dude.
Yeah. See how well l did?
So we know that they were purchased together
Looks like he knows how to have a good time.
That looks like I just threw it together this afternoon?
Well, it looks like a gift.
Obviously she is your ex. Probably not your mother.
They're healing their legs,
It was amateur night, you could tell.
I know corn starch powder when I see it.
This has got you - know - who's paw prints all over it.
Witness protection, if I ever saw.
Yeah, I'll bet.
I know of things by just a glance
And you smelled like a magazine insert.
When a gun doesn't have any bullets.
You can sure tell which is Steve 's.
And the dregs of humanity, from the looks of it.
It don't take a whiz to know that only a desperate man would drop his pants
A bit of an oddball, apparently.
Admittedly it's only a worm.
You can tell that this is a tedious job
I can readily see something wrong with this fish
You can tell that woman is a piece of garbage.
No stranger to the bench press.
With Frankie Reynolds is gonna look pretty damn suspicious.
I'm seeing big pores and mousy roots.
The dead body's kind of a giveaway.
It was the hat.
You look like a generous man. Oh do I?
That makes me laugh.
One - now it's my turn!
I imagine people like the last gentleman come out of the woodwork at a time like this.
Somebody might want to tell her about caller ID.
It seemed solid enough. Hoggle!
it just makes me sad whenever I see it
With that face, and if she's a lawyer, we should go for it!
I can tell by your suit that you're the man in charge.
Soon as I seen your clothes, I knew you was a nobleman.
When the man cub is sighted, you will sound your trumpet.
We started jamming their communications as soon as they were in sight.
The first peep from him, you come to the grown - ups.
Soon as I saw him, I noticed.
When they see Bernie, they're terrified. Terrified.
I saw you arrive and couldn't help admiring you.
One look at you, it's plain as day.
You're such a darling.
The moment l saw you.
The pain in my chest vanished.
That sees you in a crisis and then comes galloping to your rescue.
I saw it and I thought,
As soon as they see a tiny wave, they catch it!
Because you're never - ja, because we are never going to win.
First glimpse, tell me? Yes, sir.
The moment you saw me. And you didn't say anything.
Throws up on me when he looks at me.
He saw me and yielded.
I am just hopeless with numbers.
We see a white coat, our vital statistics go through the fucking roof.
I know a student's best work when I see it.
I saw the fancy invitation and I couldn't help myself.
And once he saw that it was completely empty, he locked him inside.
The minute l see those guys.
Unarmed suspects on sight for a murder
Every time you see a ghost, just ignore it?
You look pretty much exactly the same.
Particularly during sports movies.
When I play this, it feels like he's right here talking to me.
I guess I don't have to ask about cause of death.
The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.
Just by the flying dart and the light technique,
Those stupid bags of spring mix piss me off!
The portions there were tiny. Ugh.
It's funny. - what's funny?
Really? - does that come as a shock?
Really? How do you know that? Oh, don't sound so smart.
Do you think so? - I'm convinced you will.
We are? Yeah.
It doesn't make sense. Why would a cop dress up as a cop?
Pricey. Its unique.
Shut them really tight
Blink and you'll miss them, but we got them.
A super being who could move in the blink of an eye.
We've forgotten everything in a blink.
In the blink of an eye, you'll be grown and gone.
It is like, if you blink your eyes, you are already through the town.
Stole my wallet a while back.
It will be over in the blink of an eye.
Went under in the blink of an eye,
In a blink of an eyelid messages travel from Calcutta to Delhi
Not a moment ago! How extraordinary.
Next second.
He disappeared in a second
You blink, it'll be over. Two seconds.
It all happened so fast after that.
Running so imminent that I can barely think.
Well, this is gonna be over before you even know it starts. Mm - hmm.
In a flash it was over! A victorious blow!
A new compound for a flash!
Blink and die, scumbags.
It flies right on by.
It's over in the blink of an eye.
It'll be over in a flash so don't get nervous
It 'l be over in a flash so don't get nervous

Must be much more complicated than just a single specialist area
There must be other entrance.
You must not. Wherefore must I not?
You can't let anyone know you're living in my home
Must be weird.
Believe me, it couldn't possibly be any stranger than mine.
That must have been terrible.
Must be hard to come by.
Must have been upsetting
Sure thing, boss. Never trust a bunny!
Is so hard.

That wasn't the one I had given her.
Sure it wasn't me.

There's more to it than that.
I won't be leaving this time.

We must avoid any escalation of the hostilities between us.
My wife cannot find out about this.
And I'm never gonna go with more than one guy at the same time,

Without running it by you.
Your very eyes at the printer.
Is gonna have to work to get to know me some other way.
It'd be at the end of a gun.
It's gonna end in evil laughing.
To get the insurance money,
It would just break her heart, poor old thing.

There's gonna be some way to make sense of this.
And then sow seeds of doubt
He has to be sufficiently curious to step over the line.
For a surprise.
I can't think of anything more fun.
We believe they'll drop their guard, giving us the upper hand.
Maybe he's got a favorite bar or restaurant.
Would be looking for something else.
Am going to run. Just to shake up the party.
He's gonna come out hungry and pissed.
And it's gonna be great.
I'm gonna let it shine I'm gonna let it shine

We'd have seen that. Come on!
You are guaranteed someone slept with someone else.
They'd have found traces of blood in the gravel right here.
It will happen.
And it always will happen. Maybe.
And to turn up just like that,
Something terrible has to happen.
There will most assuredly be stories to tell.
And something will happen; he said it would.
She'd be giving us a lecture right now about
They’ll revoke your scholarship & force you to drop out
They'll all make fun of her. Do you want that?
So you'll be punished.
Those that committed these ugly deeds have.
They will be dealt with in the harshest possible way.
He would receive his due punishment
He just might get jumpy.
That must have been ugly.
The vomit goes everywhere.
I'd scare the crap out of her!

Had to be increasing toward a maximum
Would have a bottle of '61 single malt scotch
It's gonna blow you away.
It'll make this fight you're having seem like a little nothing.
It's gonna sell millions.
The best time's 3:15pm
And had so much potential.
It's amazing.
One doesn't keep it a secret, does one?
Gonna be a big success.
And it would be a big hit, everyone would love me, and I'd make lots of money.

Will surely find the light.
Just might be able to help you find Bigfoot after all.

I already phoned 911 a minute ago.
One minute I wanna kill you, the next minute you got me.
I was just watching your show a minute ago.
I was mad a minute ago, but it is just - it's not right.
A minute ago, back when I got you to smile,
I was standing right there just a minute ago, and you had no idea who I was.
For a moment, I thought you hadn't made it.
Just a minute ago, I heard him talking.
One minute, I'm in the yard with my brother, playing baseball,
A minute ago, I was in San Diego.
One minute, I was in my cell, and then I.

What can they do in a minute that they Didn't do all weekend?
By spinning a person at thirty revolutions a minute.
One minute. Take or leave it.
It'll be just another minute, sir. All right.
It's like 6,000 to 8,000 feet a minute now.
You got 60 seconds.
That's what he got.
Well, they're arranged according to price, and as I recall.
People get what they give, right?
You get what you paid for, brah.
Not one single dime.
Fixing your fucking sink for fucking free.
You're only a jerk if you don't leave anything.
And you Haven't bought a thing.
Not an extra cent.
And not a farthing less.
It's not gonna be anything.
Did all that for not one penny?
The closest shave you will ever know.
It won't cost you a nickel.
It won't cost you a cent.
Nothing, to look in the good book, my son.
Check was cold as ice.
doesn't get one damn dime. Got it?
Every little bit helps.
Not one cent is unaccountable for.
I was paid nothing for the rights, and will receive no royalties.
Not one dollar. The last guard in the crew dropped all five of them.
Haven't got a penny.
Not a cent. He kept saying he was pulling in less money.
I don't have a cent. The subway's closed, too.
Nothing, okay? We owed him one. He called us.
There is no money. I switched the insurance policies.
Never paid a dime on it.
Penny for your thoughts.
You are not gonna see a dime.
10 kg for 1 cent
Without making any money
I don't have any money. - shut up.
Didn't cost me a dime.
Didn't cost a thing. I made them myself.
There was no money taken.
It comes up penny, we'll be up on the ridge. We got visibility.
But a penny more than I have to,
Not a penny! It's going to trial.
Enough to live on for six months without you earning another dime.
Didn't cost a thing.
And they're gonna need every penny they can get.
He's not gonna keep a single piece of you. Give me the money.
Slanging shit in the 'hood and y' all ain't got no motherfucking money.

Until I say so.
Not one penny.
So he's bad for business.
No, not a dime. You score?
All the money is gone.
We Didn't have any money, see?
And they don't take a nickel, right?
Not a dime.
None at all? None at all.
There's nothing here! Not even us.
And don't have no money?
Not a cent...
And probably leave your family destitute too.
Not a nickel.
Cut him off without a shilling.
And Haven't made a penny.
Team one, gear up. Paradise square. Shots fired. Unknown subject.
Team one standing down.
Team one in position.
Team one, status?
Op 1, this is op 2. We still got nothing.
Team one, hot call. Gear up. Go.
Team one, disable the evac car.
Command to division one.
Team one, we got four females: one shooter, three witnesses.
Team one, team one, hot call, gear up!
Everything.
Everything! Uh - huh! Gonna lose ya!
All that we know.
Everything, everything.
Everything everything?
Everything! Everything!
Everything? - everything.
Nothing nothing
Everything? Everything, all charges.
Everything? Everything. All charges.
Just happened so fast.
It's uh, it's very fine.
Everything. More than everything.
And everything for her.
The whole carpe diem thing.
Everything seems
But then a lot of nice thingsturn bad out there
Anything and everything.
Everything! Everything's different!
Yeah, well, nothing... Nothing was.
Everything. Everything's wrong.
Everything 's... Everything's all good, man.
It 's - it's too late to change things,
Everything.It's all wrong.
It 's... It's gotta be.
Everything - everything's going to be fine.
Everything 's... Everything's gonna be fine.
Then fall back to earth in ashes.
It - it all happened really fast.
The whole thing took, like, 10 seconds and it was on.
Everything you want to know is in there.
It's too... It's too late. No, no, no. No, it's not too late.
It's, it's going all right.
Everything... Everything all right?
Everything - everything seems normal.
It's all... It's all gone!
E... Everything all right?
Is... Is everything okay? - yes, she is now.
Everything, has all the gold plate been sold?
All is well and has gone according to your plans and wishes.
This is just gonna be great.
I've been in control the whole time.
Who creates the fruit of the vine.
Yeah, it was like a message.
This doesn't have to end badly for you.
It's not gonna get better. He's gonna steal all of our clients.
This changes nothing!
Things could get a lot worse before they get better.
Everything's going to be fine.
Everything! No!
It would just be much easier.
It couldn't have all been work.
For any inconvenience I caused you.
It's not a theory anymore, lieutenant.
it's no more a mystery
It was the first time that had ever happened before,
The place where different points
Nothing was left
Well, then it all disappears, doesn't it?
Responsible for all of his own misfortunes.
There's always a way to oil everyone's lock.
You guys had itunder control, right?
It's not supposed to be that easy, and you know it.
That's not how this works.
But his Didn't used to happen before? No.
It's gonna be all right. Okay?
I rest my case.
The prosecution rests its case.
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
This isn't how it was supposed to end!
That's all this is -
You're a man haunted by those two most terrible words:
You're just imagining things.
This is all just a game, isn't it?
The only question is for how long?
Everything is just muck
Everything is dust in the wind.
Everything was great,
Things were going good, weren't they? That's exactly why I had to blow it up.
Everything's a fucking lie anyway.
That's what it's all about, isn't it?
It was great, fine.
Dump, or look'd upon this love, with idle sight, what might you think?
The things that didn't go the way you wanted.
Like every other non-magical romance,
It poisons everything it touches,
All treaties with the Indian nation
She had nothing to do with any of this!
This isn't about me,
It's not about the money.
Anything you Didn't take with a needle was okay.
Anything. Anything that outwelghs the fact.
Everything's on or off.
everything was always a game with Dan.
Anything that becomes work is no fun.
Everything belongs to whomever possesses it,
You're gonna have. And they backed down.
Everything has to have its proper place.
Everything is just a defense mechanism with you,
How much everything reminds me of him.
Everything is made of gold.
Everything, silverware, towels, everything in exactly the same cupboards
Nothing was left to chance.
For Christ's sake!
Doing all this just to keep the world safe.
Well, it's for a good cause, right?
It's all for the mission.
For the benefit of the missions.
For gay men. For gay men.
Anything for the team.
Taking one for the team. I get it.
Anything for the kids.
For the children! For the children!
All about the kids. That won't save him.
It's all about security.
Anything to increase range.
That's for charity.
Anything for charity, and anything for my man.
To save sea animals.
The things we do for love, right?
Everything for dad, huh?
Anything for Zuba's boy. Go get him tight.
In order to leave.
Anything for a fan.
All for the advancement of art, eh?
What's best for the practice
Cut them in half?
For you.
Anything for you. 'cause I love you.
Anything for you, Nigel.
Take over all duties!
After everything, you cann't just -
Everything's connected.
It wouldn't make a difference what I did.
Everything would be different now.
And it will happen again.
And everything would return to normal.
Everything, including him.
There will be no stopping them,
It would all be over.
And everything's gonna be back to normal.
Everything supposed to be settled, and normal.
It's to be expecd.
Everything may be done but in turns.
We would have been fine.
Everything the appears disappears again. don't cry.
And what is best for her. Renounce?
All bets are off.
And it was going very well, I thought, you know.
That everything had changed.
Everything swelled.
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
My nervous breakdown when the whole thing falIs apart.
And we'll be needing him before this is over.
And it's business as usual.
OutcalIs only. This is classy stuff.
Until the inquiry can establish the full facts of the matter.
The whole truth and nothing but the truth?
The picture painted broad and clear.
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things, captain Gower
And that things will be resolved fairly for everyone concerned.
Everything like the Pope almost.
Things were back to normal.
The whole thing about getting on that plane
And everything's kind of perfect for you
How everything's going to... Be.
And everything would just happen.
Everything will be explained.
Before you betrayed me.
Anything. Everything.
Everything will be all right.
Everything is everything, I ain't seen nothing.
Everything's always been about you, never about me
That whatever happened, happened for a reason.
This is all happeningbecause they left.
Everything seemed to be so spooky.
Everything was done properly.
Everything. That baby could be the key
Everything is different, but the same.
Is gonna be all right
That everything would work out well.
Everything's going to be all right, okay?
Everything will turn out fine
Everything will be alright, see?
About some very personal things.
Everything was happening very, very quick, very rapidly.
Things are getting really weird and edgy over there.
Everything just got so crazy.
And everything to do with territory.
Everything is on the record,
Everything was fine until her boyfriend showed up.
You know, things tend to work out for the best.
Get everything out in the open. No more secrets.
Everything should be in order.
Everything is an option.
Things can be fixed, you know.
Nothing means anything.
Everything could be explained by her lying to you.
This reeks of alien activity, you guys.
Anything, and I want you to remember that no matter what,
And every person in that room.
Well, everything.
Our mother, the earth, shook,
Nothing ever changes
The center of all things is the human being!
That everything is governed by logic
Nothing exists in and of itself;
Everything feels not quite normal,
Everything seems to be in order.
Everything is what it is,
As if everything is much more than itself.
Everything's on a different scale.
Everything is just all about you.
Days are starting to pull everything together.
There's always been an explanation.
Nothing's random.
And everything is so bright it hurts your eyes.
Everything is.
All things connect.
And things'll get better.
Everything over your marriage.
Everything in its place.
Everything's shipshape, but I keep hearing footsteps.
Everything is very orderly, very arranged, very clean. Wonderful.
Everything's straight.
Everything worked out alright, cos we had rules.
It's up to the fates to decide.
Then comes God.
It's your show.
She's all yours.
Let the God decide everything
Everything goes to bones.
Command me in all things.
don't try anything. Just let us handle it.
I do all the work.
You gotta let me handle this
It really is a mystery
Figuring everything out, choosing the right small business accounting program.
To all of what? The sins of your father.
None of what? I don't understand.
Everything. - what? - I will tell him everything.
All of what? All this.
from the perfect start to the finish line
That's just guesswork.
And all foes the cup of their deservings. See, see!
Everything. Everything happened to me today.
this morning has been so unexpected.
It was everything.
That's what counts.
It's still difficult.
It seems like only yesterday.
Very surreal still that we're here.
And moved on.
Again, all is well.
1791 was the year it happened.
It all started on new year's Eve, 1962.
It starts with a fairy bestowing a spell.
It all started with a phone call.
It started out as a robbery.
When did everything change?
It all began very early this morning as a bank robbery.
It all started with him.
Everything has started when he said this.
It started as an office thing, you know, light, fun.
That had commenced with Ernie announcing my death to nurse noakes.
It's how you clean it up that counts.
Everything up untiI the killing will be a gas.
Everything up until the killing... Will be a gas
Everything. What is it?
It all started 30 - odd years ago.
It was a lie from the beginning.
It all started when I realized I'm probably dying.
It begins just after sunrise.
None of it happened.
couldn't be better.
It all starts from here.
It started in Bern, Switzerland. 1999.
It starts with a quiet hum, a empty scree inviting you.
But it started with truth.
For everything... For meeting you in the first place,
I thought we'd keep things simple.
We've never actually manage to keep anything simple.
Everything begins with listening
Everything is based on the fat.
All starts here
And it all went downhill from there.
Starts there.
Start with the money.
Where to take things from here.
Everything has started there, with taking off.
By starting this post-mortem examination first.
Everything, he knew all the things
Everything - everything they've done so far
Every trace of them.
Everything they can find out from other sources.
Any assistance he can provide, Colonel.
Everything, all charges.
Everything. What kind of kid was he?
He's in charge.
Everything he looked at.
Anything he can get his hands on.
And everything was okay.
Qinning knows no pain.
Whatever.
The exciting things she wants to feel with her fingertips.
Everything scares me.
And my first priority is protecting her.
Military needs are a priority.
And we won't act rashly
It's all about her and whatever hapless salesman wanders into her sights.
That baby is the priority.
Your life is the priority, whether you like it or not.
We've gotta serve the song.
Who will put the interest of our citizens first.
I understand that, but this changes things.
Take charge of the ceremony
Whatever it takes. Everything in my power.
Just for you.
It'll be like this never happened.
That's so yesterday.
it all feels like yesterday
and it seems like all is dying, and would leave the world to mourn
Everything, it seemed, was waiting.
I was true itself. - who are you?
Then it all made sense?
It's like I see things now -
Every successful business has an origin story.
That those who would harm you will die screaming.
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
It'll be just like we planned.
All things will rise.
Looking good for a change.
And everything's gonna be better, I promise you.
And it'll be clear.
Only makes it that much more perfect.
Things are going to get better
I know everything. It went on.
It's gonna be so much better.
And that things would be much like they are now.
Everything's gonna get back to normal.
In time, everything will return to normal
Will that change anything?
Everything will be explained to you en route.
It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right
But wouldn't it be something
Everything going all right? Why wouldn't it be?
Everything will be all right. Come on now. Drink up.
Enough, hush, hush.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Everything's going to be okay
It's gonna be all right, baby.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Everything's gonna be okay, all right?
Hawkes: it's gonna be okay. Just give me the gun.
That everything's going to be okay, please.
It's gonna be okay. It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay, Maya.
Pull through, Mrs. J.
It'll be fine. Cann't happen to me.
Everything is going to be okay.
All will be well.
And everything is gonna be okay,
Everything's gonna be fine. He's gonna confess us.
Things are going to Iook up! don't worry! Come on!
Was gonna be okay. - don't be ridiculous.
Was gonna be okay. don't be ridiculous.
I think it's gonna be okay, ladies. She's turned the page.
It's gonna be okay. Okay.
Everything's gonna be all right. I promise.
This will get easier soon. I promise.
Everything's gonna be fine. I saw it.
It'll be good. Yeah?
Does it get better?
It's gonna be fine. All we need is $400.
And things could be just as before
Things'll go your way
Everything's going to be okay.
Things will work out.
This would work a lot faster, if I had an account number.
Everything's going to quiet down.
All may yet be well.
Things are gonna be... Beautiful?
It'll all work out.
And we're good to go, so long as we don't hit any snags.
Things will go back to exactly as they were?
And then things will start getting back to normal.
Should look like business as usual.
Things are gonna change, I heard... Gonna
Things are gonna change, I heard.
Everything will change now, rose you do not feel?
If she was dead.
Everything's going to be all right.
Everything's going to be all right.
That everything's going to be all right?
It's gonna be awesome.
Everything is for the better.
Everything's gonna be different now. I promise.
This is going to be harder than we thought.
Everything's going to be all right.
Now just calm down.
Everything is gonna be just fine.
It's gonna be okay. Where are you, baby?
Everything will be all right. Sister, I can handle this.
Everything will be fine, okay?
Everything will be fine, I - I promise.
It's going to be fine. Just be yourself.
It's - it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be fine, all right?
That everything could suddenly fall apart.
shouldn't you be present for all the meetings?
It's all gonna work out. Where are you going?
It's all gonna work out. Where are you going?
Was gonna matter this much? No.
Are we even gonna be able to run everything?
It's gonna be okay.
You're going to be fine. There's nothing to worry about.
All great must come from loss,
All greatness comes from loss.
All the world's great civilizations have followed the same path.
Everything just, sort of, falIs away.
Everything seems perfect.
Everything seems fine.
All is not what it seems.
Seemed easiest that way.
It just seemed so easy, you know?
Yeah, it's kind of all been one long horror story.
It seems that everything is moving.
Things seem to be getting better.
Everyhting was great. Then I met this girl and.
Everything seemed perfectly normal
Where everything looks distorted.
Balin: everything appears to be in order.
Everything seems out of place.
Everything seemed fine.
Things seem to be running fine right now.
Everything seems to be doing well. Yes?
Everything is flaring
Deja vu all over again.
Dejavu. This is so -
Everything. And you let her down.
Everything. But I wanted to hear it from you.
Anything I can buy low and sell high.
The art of the sport was reduced to something less than that.
To the outcome of sporting events.
Nothing that will disrupt trade or politics.
Everything he did to you while you were protecting me.
Anything else you can find.
Everything you've done. Everything.
Everything you can imagine.
Everything you could need to put anything on paper, to film anything,
Everything about your relationship with Virginia hill, have you?
As soon as you're done, come up.
Everything? What are you doing
Everything. You have it so easy.
Everything. What do you want from Francis?
Everything you want, everything you need.
All of that, you know, how much.
Everything, everything you've built.
You buy them everything you want.
Everything you feel.
Everything you've ever known, felt, believed.
Anything you have hidden, she'll find it.
Everything you have, somebody gave to you.
Everything you've ever dreamed of doing with a woman.
Is everything... Moving okay in there?
Everything you see, all of it, really, is her.
You saw in there.
Eh.. Everything. You wanna know what turns me on?
About him and his underlings to a federal agent.
Just things that you can draw extra power from.
Well, anything you can tell us can be helpful.
Anything you can imagine.
Whatever you can find.
Anything you can, all righ
Looking for what you can get your hands on
For everything? Cann't you be more precise?
Everything you can.
It's all in there - everything you have to say.
Everything you think you feel,
Everything you think you know.
Just do whatever you want.
Changed everything? What are you talking about?
You're in charge. I know, I'm sorry. Just keep me in the loop.
Everything meet with your approval?
Everything? You're far too eager and curious for a Hobbit.
You did everything right.
You won't remember any of this.
You remember everything so clearly.
Anything you cann't do without.
All that most Maddens and torments... - Kitai, wake up!
All missions have their complications.
Everything has caused us to become more optimistic.
Anything you want, sugar.
Whatever you say, father.
Always do what the doctor orders.
Everything is the same.
Do as planned
We'll follow the international rules.
And, well, the whole thing crumbles.
But them everything comes out
And everything will be grand. It's time you grew up.
Everything stays the same.
We kept some things there.
Keeps everything neat.
We'll keep everything nice and low - profile.
Everything will fall apart. I'm sorry, that's not my problem.
All the info about it is on our website.
Yeah, and all we knew was what he told us.
You have on Chad mills.
All repairs are temporary and short term.
Anything worth stealing
Everything worth discovering has been discovered.
Stop everything!
Stop everything. Sam!
All due festiveness, celebrations, various and sundry merriments,
It runs on its own.
It's simply not going to happen.
I'll need full access to the fraternity.
All good reasons why there are more peregrines here
~ all is alive ~
all is alive
Furthest removedfrom all light and warmth.
You know, all that matters is what happens on that stage, right?
You're shit out of luck, mommy.
It all started with this fake hair and your stupid water bras.
If not, then thank God you were lucky.
We'll leave that to darken Rahl.
It all comes down to the vehicle you use to do it.
It all changed.
'cause you're well - designed bow tie!
Above all because I was young.
Everything is in your control.
It was all over the media.
I got the situation completely under control.
All of it was my memory.
We have a plan.
All is lost.
It all pointed to a cop. Or an ex-cop.
It's all gone pear shaped.
For revenge.
She's the one calling all the shots now.
It's just shit!
It's up to you.
It's up to you.
And it's very nice that it all started here.
We're counting on you!
We're counting on you, Leonard.
It's all about heart.
All is forgiven.
It's location, location, location.
Everything about you.
About protecting this island
All that nonsense about mining claims and starting your own businesses.
Everything I learned about being a good cop, I learned from you.
To suppress any bad publicity about lifetrace.
Any forensic examination of the black stone is strictly forbidden.
That the power in all relationships lies with whoever cares less.
Of everything else you're working on.
Everything that has a wireless capability
About the company... What.
The true author of a tell - all tome has been revealed,
Things are never gonna be the way they were?
It is happening again. Amy, this was forty years ago.
Everything's gonna be normal again.
Perked up and spanking clean again,
Everything was easy.
The more chance there is of the same thing happening all over again:
Nature's full of powerful concoctions.
Everything happens to me. And now I'm shot by a child!
Here, everything is in the parents' hand.
You can always find problems with any decision,
Well, everything's prepared.
We're all set. Us too.
most of my work has been geared toward creating the illusion.
All set!
Everything's fine. Just we're all set.
Everything set?
Everything ready? Yeah.
When all is arranged, I will get word to you.
Everything ready? For the last two hours.
it's been two months since everything was ready for their work,
I soaped the floor of his cage.
Everything is in place.
Ready to go, sir!
So, everything is settled
Preparations are in order?
All hands on deck.
All set? - yes, sir.
Man your guns back there.
All gonna light the light
All in order.
All systems go!
We're ready for the start,
The stage is set and the final battle between heaven and hell is about to begin!
When we're ready, I'm gonna count backwards from three, and then you jump.
Everything is in order then?
Everything is ready now.
Is everything in place?
All is in place. They will consent to the wedding.
All prepares are ready ready to launch
All the preparations for your invasion are in order.
Everything is in position for ready or listen
Whenever they're ready the judges can go out.
Everything ready. We need transport. Understood?
I've got everything. I'll fly you up there. I've got a plane.
Everything's set. Everyone's in place.
I have everything I need. Get the car.
Se gira and we are rolling.
Once everything's deployed, we're ready to start looking around,
All is ready. There's a wounded Turk who wants to speak to you.
All set. - must we?
With everything in place, Charlie and Fred
Everything's ready. All we need now is you.
When we're ready.
We're ready for you on stage, Mr. Lefort!
All is in order, sir.
We're ready, sir.
It's like it's all brand new.
It's almost under control. Joe.
Affairs don't happen in a vacuum.
Everything else was just filler.
It is the beginning.
This is just the beginning
Just when things were getting better.
It all just got away from me, and I ended up hurting that
As a start.
The source of all creation and destruction.
There's nowhere we can go
We're in position。
All clear。 Subject identified and unarmed。 Roger that。
With how it happened and who did it。
And it'll be clear。
Everything was gonna work out in the end。
Everything is going to be perfect。
And he believes in it long enough and hard enough that it all appears before him， see?
But that all stops now。
Not anymore。
Everything ends now。 You end now。
So this is how it ends?
It's over。 I take my hug back。
This ends now。
Under the assumption that he can help us find the nuclear warhead。
Until we get the deal we want。
While you're at it, call the community to a meeting
And when everything's done, I'm gonna come back and get you。
You could tell you were completely in charge of everything that you did。
Everything, you hear me?
It makes all the trying worthwhile。
And again, the immediate push has to be on this appeal。
Despite our best efforts, an attack is imminent。
Would all their work crumble to the ground,
It's imperative。
And I'll take care of everything。
No further communication will be accepted。
Nothing's done。
Insects work in harmony, timing their calIs to fall between the notes of others。
Everything should feel natural。
It's all about to happen。
Are just about to come home to find purchase.
Everything will unravel。
Everything's falling apart。
won't stand for any more of it. Put a man into the dock, call him a Molly.
Always so real
Everything falIs apart。
But where everything still remains according to the wishes of the king!
It feels like it happened yesterday.
Something happened. Something.
It was all set. First, we'd go to college together,
None of this was supposed to happen this way.
It was all right there.
There is no excuse shall serve.
That changes everything. What?
All cold and slimy. Everything faded away like I was drowning.
Everything happened again! Exactly the same!
Well, everything is back to being as bad as usual.
Everything went back to how it was before. At least, that's how it looked.
As the dry season ends.
Everything would go back to normal.
Everything just goes back to how it was.
The coroner's report backs his story.
Things are gonna go back to the way they used to be!
And the story ended where it began.
It brought it all back.
It all comes down to tradition and conformity.
Go back to the way it was.
All of which brings us back to the motive of robbery.
It's back to square one.
Life was only just returning to the tracks.
And things got back to normal.
Things were back on track.
Everything's back to normal.
Everything was back to going off without a hitch.
It was like the 1945 may days "again"
It's all good again.
Here we go again.
It's happening again.
Everything goes weird again.
And forever start again
It all went back to normal.
It was quiet again.
All's right in the world again.
Things went back to normal.
And things get back to normal.
And thi ngs went back to normal
Things get back on track and before you know it
I guess things go back to normal, huh?
Order is restored.
Everything's perfect again.
It's all going to happen again.
It all falIs apart again.
Everything went back to how it was before, at Ieast, that's how it looked,
And everything gets back on track.
Everything's perfect again. I thought you lied to me.
All the way home I'll be warm
So it's come back to my old passion again:
Everything's perfect again. - I thought you lied to me.
And things went back to normal
And it brings me right back to reality
It's happening again, and I should be out there
That any resistance has been overcome.
Yeah, things work out.
Things were going too well?
It was going well, till one day.
It all happened so fast.
It happened. It just happened.
All takes place in a space station.
It all started a long time ago.
It all started in the second round foreman comes out swinging
I mean, it's all just flashes, you know.
This is happening so fast.
It happened so fast.
All happened so fast.
Everything happened so fast,
I - I mean it all happened so fast
It happened so fast. You know, you been working for me.
It all happened so quickly. She tried... I tried.
Everything happened so fast. I'm sorry.
Everything happened so fast. I Didn't know who else to call.
It happened so fast, there was nothing I could do.
It happened so quick, I Didn't believe him.
It all happened so fast, I don't think I'd be much help.
It happened so fast. It was snowing. The bombs.
All happened so fast. Probably just a crime of opportunity.
It was so fast and so loud.
It just happened so suddenly, you know?
It was completelYout of the blue.
It all happened so sudden.
Well, the whole thing comes crashing down, and he slides on it for like 50 feet.
It happened so quickly, she Didn't suffer.
Everything happened really fast.
It happened so fast I did it without thinking.
It was all so stupid.
All this happened rather quickly.
It all just happened so fast.
It happened s - so quickly.
And I wanna see her eyes as I do it.
As if the living I've done so far hasn't actually been real life
Events that have happened are happening now.
That happened because two men woke up this morning
It happened really fast.
And it happened real quick.
Everything so quick!
Everything's moving kinda fast. Maybe we should slow it down.
It all happened so fast, but.
It all happened really fast. I don't even remember if it was painful.
Everything happened so fast. I went to go help him.
It all happened so fast, you know?
It all happened so fast.
Everything happened so fast. Just like what I saw
I was in orbit when it happened
Things are moving faster than I thought they would.
Everything happened fast
The day everything changed.
How the hell am I supposed to launch the drug?
It's all up to him.
Everything depends on you.
It's up to the ladies.
That's up to her, isn't it?
All depends on whether or not we're able to learn from our mistakes.
Everything's back to being up to us again.
It's, you know, it's how the picture makes you feel.
You gotta make 'em happen it all depends on you
Everything depends upon speed.
Everything was moving so fast.
It goes by so quickly.
Nothing's turned out as I expected, Ashley.
Everything becomes unstable.
Everything has become more complicated.
It's just, everything's changing so fast.
It just became so terrible.
it only gets better
Things got worse.
Everything is interesting.
And there's just nothing now.
Everything became clearer.
It's becoming as plain as day. It has been to me for some time.
It all became very real.
Everything we've become is bullshit!
Cann't be any better
It was such an empty,
It's just gotten so bad.
The whole thing just fell apart.
It all becomes numbing.
And it's all your fauIt this is all so fucked up.
It'll be a relief.
Give the contract back before things get out of hand.
Any password.
It was all over in 10 seconds.
Everything is nothing more than
But only you.
All to curry the favor of a lousy king.
You've somehow made this all about you.
Which you know can only end in disaster.
Things get worse, not better.
There's nowhere to go but up.
And it's only getting worse.
All 'cause you won't listen
All this for Constance?
And it can mean whatever we want.
It's all because you broke a promise!
All of this is just
And it's all just a fairy tale.
About the whole misunderstanding.
That's what this gets down to is a baseball card?
It was all just a fantasy.
It's about her and her mind games.
It was only the beginning.
It's all about fast cars and cussing each other
It was all a bad dream.
And all because a young girl
Because I cann't give you a chiId. Well, you know what?
That she imagined it?
It's just a big series of coincidences, OK?
And this is just the beginning.
Anything more would be mere speculation.
All gussied up, but dead inside.
Just all innuendo.
All we have to do is wait.
It's just a matter of time now.
Well, that all tracks.
They were just moving on.
ain't nothing over till it's over.
It has to be done manually.
Dependent on your sighting system.
And all it would have taken was for her to simply say,
That they could be.
It can happen so quickly.
It should be simpler than this, shouldn't it?
That could have exonerated my father was on that plane.
Nothing has changed. Everything has changed.
Anything that'd burn and keep us warm.
There's nothing here that cann't wait till tomorrow.
Anything metal where items can be hidden.
Whatever creates the fewest ripples.
It could be just like it was. No!
All well?
Is everything OK?
Everything okay? No. I gotta go to work.
Everything OK? Why don't you ask your roommate?
How do you do, fellow kids?
Everything all right?
How's it going? Good. Great, actually.
Everything all right, miss. What do you want?
Everything okay? - Oh, yeah.
Everything okay?
Is everything all right?.. To give him a deadly virus.
Everything okay? Everything's all right, boss.
So, tell me, how's everything going, darling? Did Marcel come and fetch you?
Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
everything changes.
Any suspicious personsor activities.
Anything out of place.
Everything's so fucking green.
Anything that could've been, has happened somewhere.
Everything that can make the urine brown,
It would be different.
From the environment.
To all the possibilities.
That things maybe really are black and white!
It may be a cultural misunderstanding.
Everything that could fucking go wrong
All of which are constantly diverging.
Anything that is corruptible is susceptible to their influence.
I Didn't get all this by being stupid.
Anything with a taste for human.
Nice to have things legal and tidy, don't you agree?
Everything fits. It's a good ending.
Everything is coming at me at once and I just want it all to go away.
The decisions and its consequences rest with me.
But they were mine and they were mine alone.
don't worry about the mess.
I understand
Look, I'm the one who created this mess.
Play for that motherfucking money.
It's about money.
Just follow the money.
Going where the money is or taking down old ladies.
Follow the money. Copy that.
What, go where the money is? Tried that. Failed.
Anything? Anything.
Everything? Yes, everything.
We got other leads we can follow.
For I resign to thee.
Whatever you say.
It's under my command. OK?
Whatever you want to do.
I'll do whatever you want.
Anything you say, honey.
Okay, dad. Whatever.
I am yours to command.
I will, if you want me to.
I will respect that.
I will do whatever you ask.
It's in the hands of the goddess now.
Yeah, all those hostages to fortune.
To do as commanded.
That's just the reality of it,
I'm your girl.
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.
Whatever I fucking desire.
Nobody moves until I signal.
I'm the boss of you, OK? So calm down.
Listen to your T.O., you're golden. See, now that's a horoscope I can actually get behind.
Everything sounds wonderful.
Everything. Look, if you could just trust me,
doesn't that sound simply gorgeous?
Which sounds incredibly noble until you kill someone.
Is, uh... Is everything okay?
Anything goes.
And all will be as it was before.
It'll be just like it used to be.
You know, everything with you has to be so jokay.
It doesn't have anything to do with you anymore. Okay?
Any sort of... Contact with you.
And everything about these murders says gangs.
All the songs we know about babies.
All that stuff that was by the pallet had been moved over there.
And all that is peace.
Peace on earth, goodwill to
Anything Italian, except anchovies.
Anything that dies.
For a connection to the Romanians.
Anything would be ours for the taking.
Everything. GirIs all fit a profile.
I'll take care of everything
Everything? What does that mean?
Flows all that is good,
After all the commotion, I peeped my peeper out the peephole,
Everything. Hey, don't get me wrong here.
So it's back to you - your... Travalls yield anything on our mystery impressions?
Everything is back to normal.
Starting over.
They're back to where they started.
Everything's come full circle.
We're back in business!
Back on track. Feel free.
Everything back to normal.
All will be peace and quiet
Everything returns to the way it was,
Peace.
And... It's finally peaceful. No monsters, no disease, no death.
Everything. Back to normal.
aren't you glad things are back to normal?
Everything is better when she's there.
It all began with Ernest, with his obsession.
It started as a lump under your arm.
You caused it.
Starts with the family jewels
I started this, and now I need to finish it.
Well, guiIt could be a powerful motivator.
It changed everything.
Hoarding started with the mom.
Begun by blood,
Things are so much smoother when we lie
For just about everything,
Like no problems pressing down on my shoulders.
It's all about you.
It's all about you, isn't it?
All of you creatures.
Nations and men of every language worshipped him.
This'll all be over in the next hour. Frank, um -
There are all about the teams
It's all about accepting who you really are.
It's all about strategy, outmaneuvering the opposition, bending him your will.
Everything's going to change today.
And the truth is, nothing I ever do is good enough.
To be better than all of those that fell before him.
Everything is part of a big.
It all happened in seconds.
Everything is organized in an anonymous chat room
Worked so well we let you do it again.
All... Comfort... Fled.
Whatever they Cann't get at home.
We've got the whole thing ranged. If they come, we'll take 'em.
We can reacquire the subject. She'll be unaware of survelllance.
I am in control. I very much doubt it.
He is fully prepared for all possible contingencies. He will be fine.
That's up to me.
It's all in me. Something like that.
I will get it under control.
I had everything under control.
It went round and round in my head! Everything was spinning!
It all just became so clear to me.
shapes to melt into its own
Everything looks the same to me. You don't know where you're going?
With a massage, everything is connected.
Everything's under control, except one detail,
it's under control. don't worry.
It's all about losing yourself and just experiencing.
It ended with a chair.
They can believe all sorts of things about the other person that are just not true.
To end here, like this?
Everything feels different here.
It was a peaceful moment of closure.
all in due time. Lovely. Yes. BIow.
Search every acre of the high - grown field, and bring him to our eye.
Everywhere.
It all started last spring,
Everything's arranged.
I saw everything with my own eyes. What do you mean by "almost"?
From the covergirl queen collection.
This all began with the burning of pages
You got all swept up in the mad whirl of the city.
Or anything bad anywhere ever again!
With modern society.
Full transparency. Absolutely.
Oh, everything comes easy, right?
Everything is kinda falling into place.
Nothing much has really changed.
Everything's... Louder.
Things seem to be on the upswing.
That went well.
All will be as it was.
And everything will be the same.
It all gets pretty simple, doesn't it?
Of the distractions of the outside world.
Everything. - enough.
Everything. Enough.
We have to exploit whatever talent is given to us and our talent is for dying.
Everything's... God, good.
It was perfect.
Everything. Great.
Everything is just perfect.
And it was perfect. Romantic. We stayed up all night talking.
The world keeps on spinning.
It's over, Jenna.
Seems quiet. No wolves so far.
She told me something totally crazy, but was too freaked out to find the words to explain it.
It's all so simple.
Is all too strange.
Everything he took too far.
It was too easy.
It's too late.
Lost and found everything
All fail.
Everything. The women and the drinking.
Most everything woman... Have you seen her in the movies?
Everything she could have been.
All right? I mean, the job.
Good and loyal you've ever done.
And all the good that was done by the promotion gets washed away.
It's like the old days again, eh?
With everything ahead of us we left everything behind
wasn't it yesterday?
Was that, like, insane, or what?
We seemed to have to start all over again.
Everything feels.
Everything seems really different.
Brings it all back, you know?
And yet it all seemed to be happening in slow motion.
Everything's just... Better.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense. - Ohh, tangerine.
Nothing makes any sense. It's okay. It's okay.
Everything okay?
Are you all right? How are you?
Everything okay? Yes, sir.
Everything'll be fine.
Okay? We can work this... Fifteen minutes.
Fortunately everything went well, did it not teodoro?
Everything is... Perfect.
There was so much drama and chaos going on.
Everything good.
Everything's fine. Let's just -
It will be fine.
It was all very premeditated,
Good luck and everything.
Good luck with everything.
Very best of luck, sir.
Good luck getting out.
And may luck go with you.
Will are recovered.
How is everything?
How's it going? You've got something for me.
How it all began
How's it going, miss drama?
All is prepared as you have asked.
Any way you want it that's the way you need it
Everything's as requested.
Thirgs'll go your way
Did everything work out the way you wanted?
Anything you want. Let's go.
Everything is as you requested.
It was just as you said.
It will happen exactly as you planned.
Everything is as it was.
It Didn't seem real.
Normal?
Nothing ever happens.
Then like nothing ever happened, it's decorated with all sorts of stuff.
Stick to our regular routine. Give nothing away. Not until we know what Lionel's up to.
Everything's calm, Alexander Vasilievich.
All's quiet, but we can locate unit four.
Is everything all right, mam?
Same as ever? Yeah.
We're good... Just like this.
Noing's changed. I'm still the same person.
Everything's OK, I went down the street and bought something
The usual. Anything good?
Everything looks normal and she starts cleaning, wiping everything down.
It is what it is, and things are going to move very quickly now.
As always, your Majesty, so don't complain.
Just the way you like it, sir.
It's all great. I'll tell you, man.
That hath all achieved!
And things are going the way I want them to.
That's all I ask.
Whatever I want, right? Within reason, yes.
It went just as I expected.
It all worked beautifully just as I had planned.
Just like before.
Nothing's changed, so... I do have to go.
Everything is just the same.
Nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children, and I still do.
Everything went like clockwork.
Everything. - if this is the key to everything.
It turned out so right
And this is how the message ran
it's all so clearly
It's all so familiar. My heart skips a beat.
And it was so bad, Cal.
Everything felt so good,
just to think that something so beautiful
It all felt so easy and so good.
Whatever Ellis grey wants.
It's totallYout of control.
And they sting like a lash, sir.
Right on schedule, gentlemen. Keep it tight.
It's all to be expected.
Everything's fine.
Is everything set? - yeah, Jimmy's down with the two girls.
Is everything set? Yeah, Jimmy's down with the two girls.
All wrapped up with a signed confession.
It started in 1945.
It started about, um, six years ago
it starts with a kiss
It all started as a routine traffic stop
and it all started last week, with a kiss.
This all started about two and a half years ago
It began around 4 billion years ago,
And it had everything to do with her.
I mean, it all started when she booked that out of London a few months ago.
It all started in the liver, but where in the liver?
Hm, to think it all started with a bike.
That's where all this started. Maybe it's where it'll all stop.
Why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be.
Everything's temporary.
Trains ran on time.
All clear, Sarge.
We're clear .- I don't know where you think you are,
Clear. Stand down.
Nothing, clear. Stand down.
All clear? - come on down.
All clear? - clear.
All secure. It talks to the refrigerator.
Clear. Come on. - here you go
Okay, we're clear. Let's go.
All clear. Copy that.
All clear! Check under the desk.
When it's safe.
Coast is clear, let's go.
Everything is secure, sir. - get in there and check it out right now!
All okay.
Is everything all right?
Everything looks good, but because he a month early,
What up, party people?
Yeah, everything's perfect. You're perfect.
Everything was great. Do you have a dessert menu?
That's right. You are fine.
Everything's fine. Just calm down.
So far, so good. - good to go.
don't worry, all is well.
Is everything okay?
What's going on? It's been too long, mama.
Is everything okay? Yes, and you?
Is everything all right? - you tell me.
So everything's all right, huh?
Everything all right, Mr. Fox?
Everything is fine, my lady.
Everything all right, gran?
All good, Eldad.
Everything's fine. It's just a - a little plumbing issue.
Is everything all right ?- yes, of course.
Is all well? Very good. Thank you.
Everything cool? Yeah, yeah, they're fine.
It's all good, or it will be.
just you make arrangements for that
Everything settled then? Yes.
Everything was arranged. Could he have gone abroad?
It's all taken care of.
You're all clear and ready to rock and roll.
Ball is rolling.
Our tactics were necessary. Now cIear out and let us do our job.
Everything is fine!
And quiet,
When it got quiet.
And I don't want to tell her until I have everything set up.
It's over, Curtis.
And after everything's said and done, maybe we can get this bullet back to him as a souvenir.
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.
Absolutely everything depends on you.
Everything's gonna be all right. It's all good.
All secured. - okay.
You're good to go.
And everything's finally done.
When complete, report to your quarters
It went perfectly!
And it was perfect
Everything just perfect.
Everything that's official, maybe.
There is no certainty without evidence.
It's so weird how things work.
The rules which guide us in deciphering all secret writing
You made it look so easy.
Everything's a joke with them.
Everything for them is so simple. They start out with a clean slate.
He's too old for anything!
And everything's great,
Since I started back to work,
Everything's possible for you
Everything's always a joke with you, isn't it?
Everything is so new, so untouched for you.
Is everything so easy for you?
Everything in the world was new.
Everything is still so new.
That everything is perfect for you.
Everything worked to our advantage.
Everything? Ja. I bench press 400 pounds.
Nothing makes any sense to me! - you're not getting old.
I'm for anything that allows me to do my job.
Everything was hard for me.
It's still really new.
The utter futility of everything.
Everything's a joke to me.
Everything is so strange here.
Everything that was ever important to me here.
Everything seems like nothing to me.
Everything that is important in my life.
Whatever's good for him is good for Nashville. - mm - hmm.
Things are no longer going to unfold as I had feared.
Then all matter will dissolve into nothingness.
The dance ends.
And nothing... Will ever be the same.
Everything's going to be different!
It... Will... Be... Different.
Everything will change for her.
It's all gonna turn off. What?
It's going to turn off, and it will never turn back on.
It's gonna happen, and you're gonna save her.
Everything's gonna change,
Everything would be so easy.
Then all will follow in their wake.
How perfect everything would be.
Things were going to return to normaI.
Everything is about to change.
Everything's gonna be okay.
It's going to be all right now, okay?
Everything will begin anew.
It might get around that your bank is less than ideal, don't you think?
What's it going to be then?
Nothing's ever gonna change.
It'd be nice.
And all would be right with the world.
It's all coming up after the break
And it all goes down tomorrow.
Where we shall reenact it.
It's really going to shake things up,
Everything is going according to plan.
Everything will start to make sense.
Everything's going to be just fine.
One thing will follow another.
Everything that's -
Everything's gonna be different now.
And everything will burn, doctor.
Everything is falling apart.
This is all ending, this time of our lives.
It's gonna be magical.
Its cloak of darkness over the world
We're almost at the finish line, my love.
Everything would be settled.
Little by little, everything will return to normal.
It'll all start again.
It will sweep us all away.
But it's in your hands.
Be careful,
Be careful.
Watch your back, okay?
A necessary precaution.
Be careful, Aram
And this whole thing goes away,
Is that you look out for me once the dust settles.
Everything's all right.
The future's not set.
It doesn't end.
This isn't over.
All is not lost, father.
Everything's just fine and dandy
All attempts to recreate your mother.
All that changes.
It's gonna stop anything?
I know it wouldn't have happened.
If that original data had truly been destroyed.
And you start protecting her from them.
All of this for that.
So all this is about revenge.
All to save ten dollars a month?
Is that what this is all about?
It all starts with a horse.
Everything would be different.
Then everything is different,
Things would have been different.
That anything has really changed for us?
Then everything gets mixed into the batch.
Everything would be okay.
Things will change.
That things would go back to the way they were.
The patterns become clear.
It would all become so real.
That it would all make sense, but.
Everything's going to go back to normal.
All hell breaks loose and we'll never solve this.
Everything would be fine.
It'll all be fine.
And I will feel all right
It'd be OK.
Then everything would have been fine, but he's not.
Everything would be different.
Everything would change, but.
It will disappear forever
Everything will be fine.
And all this will go away.
If you said the words.
That will end it all.
And it would all be over.
They start over, build their own pipeline.
And all will be well.
Set up!
Should all be in place by now, right?
Everything is in place now.
Everything is in position. He has entered
Okay, chief. Here we go.
Everything's in. Salad's almost done.
All tied up, one event to go, rifle range is our bread and butter -
Take care of everything, the both of you.
Run like a movie and you know I'm feeling all right
Just like old times, huh?
It all checks out as you said.
It all went like you thought it would,
Like it was happening all over again.
Everything turned out just as we'd hoped. I love a happy ending.
Just like the sign says... Herbs, spices, and teas.
As if a name means something,
It was a fantasy.
That whole kind of like the dark side of beauty.
Everything changes.
This will all be finished.
It will all come out, and then, and then
It would all fall apart.
It all comes down to this, folks!
Then it'll blow everything.
All in the time of a few waltzes.
And it happened backstage.
But that day is yesterday
This is where everything happens.
And everything changed.
He's never been the same. - Oh, no.
He's never been the same. Oh, no.
That everything would be fine?
The more everything is fine.
Should be ready to back all these things.
A few months and everything will be the same.
Tonight's the night.
It's actually passing you by.
Everything's gonna start going our way.
And this is where it happens the first day.
This... Right here.
That's when it happened.
It's gonna be too late.
It's always just seemed so.
It was like nothing had ever changed.
It was as though he did not exist.
He was an easy target.
Everything seems like a miracle.
Become okay?
It played out exactly like I said.
Everything would've been perfect.
It gets as dark and quiet as the grave.
And that'll be the end of it.
The game is over
Then this is over, you're over!
All heck breaks loose. I'm out. Oh, leave it to the beaver.
That's the end of it, the end of the lineage.
And get it over with?
All would be golden.
What you had done to her.
If that son of a bitch disappeared.
That's in our manual.
That's when it all began -
Everything starts to fall apart.
It moves up the chain.
This all will be over soon.
Everything just goes back to the way it was?
Cann't go back and change anything.
It'll be fine.
You're home.
Home free.
We'll fuck it up. Right on.
And night becomes day.
As long as nobody conducts a probe into my tissue bank,
Everything will work out.
And then it's game over, pal.
Everything is everything.
Everything is a dance.
All for this.
And all there is... Is now.
And it all starts with that candy apple.
That's where this all started?
That's where it all started for me.
That's when all started.
It's everything you are.
This is where it all happens.
Right over there is where it all happened.
And everything is a lot.
That's what this is all about, isn't it?
This is - this is how everything works.
And that's how it all starts.
That's how this all started.
And that's just the way it is.
That's quite a story, huh?
So that's how it started.
It happened slowly, gradually. You hardly notice it.
And that's how it all started.
Everything is beautiful.
Well, that's when all this started.
That's how it all started.
It's going to be too late.
Everything gets easier.
That's when the trail goes cold and I cann't find him.
And that is an end of it.
That that was it?!
I could make it work.
There is no case.
And everything will be all right.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Things have been a little less cheery around the house.
And we will be done with it.
And that then all would be clear.
And all that went away.
It'll all blow over, and you'll come work with me.
It's just, case closed.
It is out ofyour hands, white wolf.
OK. Set it up for tomorrow. How we doing for expenses?
Then it all becomes very logical.
None of this ever existed.
If the police just had some proof.
We're ready.
And that's that.
Then it will be done,
All set, chief.
Everybody's ready!
Is all in place?
Was ready.
We're good. We're good. We've got everything.
Yeah, all set here. Rika?
All set, coutta?
Everything's in place.
Ah, are we primed?
Is everything in place? You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Are we all right for it? Yes!
Everything in order? Everything.
Is everything under control?
Bang! The deal is going to port, eh?
Everything set, bough? Just about, sir.
Everything's ready to mark the whore.
Ready for launch, sir. Commander.
Trap's set, ray.
Yes, master Oogway.
We'll let you know when we're there.
All right, you guys ready?
Okay, all set. You can change.
We are all set. Your chariot awaits.
Everything's set. What did you tell them?
Got everything we need. Let's get this started.
Standing by. Ready to tap and trace.
Ready and standing by, sir.
We're ready, Mr. Cahill.
Already done. Only unn refuses to comply.
We're all set up. All we need now is a location.
Everything is ready for a test run.
All ready. Stage boat ready?
When they think she's ready, they buy her dresses.
They'll prepare me, then place me in my cryostat.
And with everything set, the urban fixing can commence.
we're all good. let's roll out.
It's all right, this.
Areyou set? Uh - huh.
All ready for you to set them up. I even got the push pins you asked for.
And everything else is falling into place. Great.
We're set, boss.
All set! - all right.
All set! All right.
Everything set. Good.
All set. okay. Go ahead.
We're up, baby.
Yeah, I got him all tuned up. Right, general?
All clear, general.
All is ready, general.
D to pull all sorts of strings to get us in.
We can move as soon as we're ready and armed.
You're all set nice and clean
All good? - yeah.
It's all clear. We're packing up.
Plan's in place. We're almost there.
All set. We should get going. - have you read these studies?
Everything's in place. Let's go.
Are we in? Buckled?
All hands lay to. Raise the stabilizers!
Everything's in place, Sarge.
All eyes are up. - sat cams are good.
Path is stable, copy that.
Ready as we'll ever be, stick.
Everything's ready. Hayasaki San
Everything set? Uh, yeah.
Okay. All set, Mr. President.
The table's been set. Let's get to the main course.
And all's good to go. They then abandoned her.
She was prepped and everything, but the heart was flawed.
We're in position. Proceed.
It's down and locked.
Ready to deploy, captain.
We're ready, sir. About damn time.
Everything's copasetic, Herr Lehmann.
How long before everything's in place?
Right, gentlemen, silence please. On the count of three.
All ready. This is gonna be a blast. Yay!
We have a go. Initiate gravitational spin.
Ship ready. Give her Lee helm.
She's ready. Just set the date.
All set, sir.
Everything's in place, ready to go.
Set to jet, macgruber.
And things can go the right back to the way they were.
It can all go back to the way it was.
Everything will go back to normal.
Things can go back to normal,
Everything kind of went haywire.
And the whole thing just began to flow.
It's about to go down.
And this is where it ends.
Everything's gonna be okay.
It's all happening right now.
And ended things.
This will all be resolved.
Just let fate take its course.
You will get over it. I'm living proof.
The sooner life gets back to normal.
The more it seems to contradict the actual experience of sight.
When you've got someone you can tell everything to. Yeah?
Everything - it just happened.
It's all settled then.
So, this is all going to spin along from here.
And it all became real.
I still cannot believe that it's all over.
Is that how it went down?
And it all leads to something else.
That's all over and done with,
Is this how it's going to end?
And so it ended, not the way it does in comics, but the way it often does in real life.
The way it all worked out, don't you think?
It seems to grounding to a haIt in a minute.
It just happens.
And everything just got so easy.
And with everything that was going on
Hardly a stretch.
It just happened.
Things would be different.
It's rather a moot point.
And that would've made the timing work out right.
Everything could go back to the way it was.
That everything would be okay.
It would make everything right again.
Everything was clear.
And everything changes.
Where everything changes,
It would all work out.
Everything at your fingertips, but just out of reach.
Everything that's been lost
And everything will just be fine.
And everything was alright.
And he'll be fine, right?
Everything will come apart.
Everything was back to normal again.
Thanks for playing.
And make a real mess of everything, you know? Hey
Nothing's ever the same.
It was clear -
Then it will be too late.
And everything's going to be fine.
And this is all over.
It will all be for nothing.
Everything fell into place.
It was all for nothing.
It's finished.
And that was that.
Everything comes to an end?
And all of this will be over, okay?
It's all over, and I'll abide by that.
It'll all be gone, and I'm not prepared for that.
We can figure this out.
It would all make sense, at least for half an hour.
And all is forgiven. Makes me sick.
That's all it takes.
Everything is exactly the way it should be.
Okay, and everything's going to be okay.
And then the whole thing will just go away.
So everything else explainable,
Everything's back on track. Let me talk to him.
That's all followed by 30 minutes of aerobics and 2 fish - oil capsules.
And all on the sixth anniversary of 9/11.
But obviously the gods have seen -
 I don't have to say it
I don't have to say it
It's not about words.
Words would ruin it,
Without as much as a word, you've said everything, darling
Where everything gets said but nobody's talking.
More than words - more than words
It's all ahead of them.
He just uses everything at his disposal. The movement, the music.
Quality you can drive.
It's in the eye of the beholder.
Big daddy's got this all under control.
 is all you have to do to make it real
A vampire is always in control.
She's the one in control.
From the covergirl gueen collection.
Find out on "survivor Tocantins."??
It's all on the other side of this break.
Right here, right now.
Delaware's got it all.
In the monster truck rally!
Because I have everything under.
Because we control our own destiny.
We are in control.
With the world at our fingertips.
I've got it under control.
I have everything under control.
I have it under control, okay?
I got it all under control.
I'm on top of it. - no, not so far, you're not.
The whole being dominated thing, OK?
And all of it right at my fingertips, a laptop click away.
Everything's under control. Oh, no!
I have it all under control.
It's all happening right now on "make me a supermodel meet the models.
It's all in the fold.
Onstage at the hard rock hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
Everything is under control.
I got this.
It's all under control
Everything's under control.
We have everything under control
Everything under control, Frith? - yes, sir, thank you.
We've got everything under control, okay?
Everything is in place. Tomorrow, when our friends gather.
I had it all under control, until you showed up.
It's under control. This is more important right now.
Controlled situation.
Everything in check.
I'm all over it, okay?
 Oh, you got it together, baby
Secu right about now.
That everything is neat and tidy,
All under control.
It's under control, woody. We have a plan. - we're going to daycare.
Everything's under control. Go back. You call that under control?
I got it under control, okay?
It's all we could arrange, kiddo.
I got the eyes. Now let's go get the prize.
I got everything under control!
It's handled.
The situation is under control. Thank you.
Everything's under control. You better fucking man up.
Everything is handled. don't worry.
Everything was all set up and you blew it.
When you put on the intersect, huh?
I am handling this. Oh, God.
I got it. - okay.
All under control. Stand by for regular contact. Kirk out.
I can handle anything. Right? I am cobra.
Looks like everything's under control. I'll take my break.
Everything is handled? Everything is not handled.
Everything under control? - looks that way.
Everything's under control. Could do with a head chef, though.
Nothing you cann't handle. So, Mike.
It's under control. That's what Elias says.
Everything is under control, I got everything.
It's all under control. It'll be a very fast clean - up.
Now is everything.
Eating out of your paw.
it all happens now on "big brother".
All in the comfort of our own living room.
All ahead on the primetime gave the we Emmys.
It's in the bag.
Everything's in motion.
In a private, personal, exclusive interview.
I foretold you so!
It's all - access, man.
All is nothing. Therefore nothing must end.
It's gone.
It definitely shows.
So help you God? - no.
Everything is significantly better than okay.
We will be up and running.
The whole encounter will be balanced on a razor.
Everything is ready and set
Everything stops.
Everything comes to plan.
As ready as we'll ever be.
Everything's been arranged
The wheels are already in motion,
All has turned to vain ambition.
It's all dust and ashes. Just like the song.
Everything's arranged for me to stop the train.
Bring us to green.
We're all saddled up. Anybody got an idea what the target is?
And there's an end to it.
There's nothing you can do about it.
There's just the way it is, and I cann't fix that,
It's all under control. Good.
Everything cleaned.
There is no going back?.
it's too far gone.
Nothing couId be done.
I've done everything you've asked me.
The secret is out!
Agent McBride just became an open book.
All this has happened before
It's already happening.
All this has happened before and will happen again.
Got to be lucid, vigilant.
Everything's under control, sir. Okay, what's the time frame here?
It all just kind of happened.
yet so perfectly... Ly aligned
Everything's ready.
Oh, yeah, and everything was in place -
It has begun.
Enough is enough.
It already has.
Nothing is holding us back.
It's what I did.
The fact remains, this is our fauIt, we made it happen:
Things are as bad as they could possibly get.
It's already over.
It's over, you know that, right?
It's over, and they'd just be stupid tapes.
It's over. There is nothing you can do.
Everything has already been decided. For that very reason. Show them!
So, all over then?
The clock is ticking.
All, Paris has everything,
Finding the right place for everything?
This all seems quite ordinary.
Everything an equal share as should be the location of the treasure too.
Yeah, everything's fine, sir. Please just stay in your seat. - yeah. Looks peachy.
Everything shouId be okay.
Everything looks quiet and normal. Nothing unusual to report at this time.
After it was over, I left town, alone.
It's plain as it can be
It's plain as it can be they thought of you and me
All cons are equal!
All this stuff about making everything equal.
Clean as a whistle.
All is calm! All is bright! Around yon virgin mother and me!
All clear. You have go.
Everything was quiet. So I ate my dinner in my shack.
Everything. Our age, our memories, will be undone.
Everything is not as it seems.
It's not how I thought it would be.
Everything doesn't seem to appear like what it is.
Everything isn't always so black and white.
It's not gonna be easy,
Everything. I'll drop the case altogether.
It's never over.
It isn't the rest of the world that's wrong?
This isn't over, not yet.
It's not perfect.
Everything comes to him -
It has everything you need.
Everything could have changed. Our whole lives could have changed.
Everything that should be forgiven is forgiven.
The spy world where everything
This is all happening, so much faster than I thought it would.
And it all began with a revolution in glass making in 16th century Venice.
It all started on a night like tonight.
It all begins with a dangerous hike
It started three weeks earlier.
It started three nights ago.
It all started a couple days ago.
It started at Stanford.
And all that begins right here.
They begin and they end.
Everything started to come unglued.
Everything started getting loud.
Something not yet here has begun.
Things are looking up.
It slowly faded.
Things were coming to an end.
When it - when it started, it was just the money.
She was so little when all this started.
When it all started, please.
That's where I was the night all of this started.
Everything powerful is dangerous.
And after all the dust and custody was settled,
 all is calm.
And life soon returens to normal
Straight. Right angles.
All thanks to the work of two of Boston's finest,
To my grandmother.
I control it.
And life soon returns to normal.
Comes down to that precious word "freedom. '
all become zero.''
all become zero.'' what couId this mean?
It's a goose egg!
An avalanche destroys everything in its path.
All power corrupts, but some must govern,
Everything, when the bomb fell on Hiroshima.
Abhor violence in all its forms.
The welcome is spoiled.
All signs are clear that he is coming.
Everything is going well.
Nice things. Nice people.
Everything's gonna be fine. The car will be here any second.
Everything's fine. No one noticed.
It's all good, Mr. Miles. Glad to have you here.
Everything will soon be set right.
It'll all make sense soon,
Before the walIs cave in.
All will be well soon.
It will pass away soon enough.
Pretty soon things are gonna start to get back to normal.
And it will all be over soon.
This will all be over soon.
This'll all be over soon. Promise.
This will all be reclaimed by the earth soon enough.
Everything's gonna be fine real soon.
Everything will be crystal clear soon enough.
It quickly became clear
Everything's going to be back to normal real soon.
And will soon be 'all over. "Sara's all over" what?
Something dangerous,
It was just natural, he just had it.
The procedure went fine.
It all started about two years ago.
It all started back in new York six weeks ago.
I may have to start from scratch.
It started when I was three,
We are doing what I want to do.
Steps had to be taken. And a verbal warning wouldn't suffice?
Everything now depends upon the husband that woman takes.
From now on everything to do with this case goes through me, understood
Everything depends on how we behave.
I guess you have to guess that on your own
We do this right.
Any little thing.
Everything must've been packed together at enormous density.
Is everything necessary on hand?
It must come to an end
It has to end here.
Well, it's gotta be done right, like anything worth doing.
Everything has to be perfect.
Everything has to be spick and span.
Everything has to be rehearsed.
Everything must be changed or our lives will be deteriorated
Exactly as I said.
As is waiting until the baby's born.
It has to stop
Want everything gone through with a fine - tooth comb.
Everything must start over again.
This you must do alone.
Any true pleasure comes with a price.
It's almost over.
Everything just makes sense.
How did all of this get so messed up?
Everything is not supposed to make sense.
So how's everything going? Good.
And that this day shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.
Things are gonna be okay.
We're destined. It's always been that way.
It's always the mother's fault.
It's always fit perfectly before.
It's always been about you.
There's always a loose end.
Things are finally looking up.
All relationships are difficult,
As though it were only yesterday.
I can remember everything as if it were yesterday.
Before the fear.
All those fears... Because you drank, I developed a hatred for alcohol.
The core of any phobia is
It all SMED to be fine.
Going back to the way things were.
Well, everything is healing very nicely.
For it to go backto the way it was. Before I had angels to deal with 24/7.
There I was again, keeping secrets, living a lie.
Bringing its bad luck.
It's all back on.
Back in business.
Everything goes back to normal.
We are gonna get our lives back.
Everything's back to normal, and it's gonna stay that way.
I guess we're back to normal now, huh?
The nightmare is over. It's OK, boo. What's the matter?
Things go back to normal. How can we be sure it'll work?
Glad to see everything back up and running.
This is the way it's supposed to end.
Everything in its right place.
Right in the sweet spot. I think you're gonna be really happy.
It all starts to happen when the sun goes down.
All the tricks and the tomboyness, I love it all.
Yeah, all without a sound.
All those regrets
Everything you need is here.
You know everything?
Then I trust that everything's to your satisfaction?
It's all good.
You know it's going down?
So all the planning is covered with your plan, right?
That it has the situation completely under control.
Circumstances can always be arranged.
She is in recovery.
Emotionally scarring experiences.
Everything, Wellington. It cann't go on. I cann't take any more.
Watch anything, anyone I wanted to see,
It was pleasantly uneventful.
Everything felt good. Your welght was in the right place.
Right about that.
Everything fades away.
All that remains is ash
 and everything were memories
It's been real.
Everything. And I won't forget it.
I Didn't do anything.
We got flyers up, posters up, we have all that stuff up.
Everything, everything that we hoped for.
We developed it.
Everything that we're doing here - falIs apart.
All the things we cann't make for ourselves.
Everything we've ever dreamed about.
We have her passport. We have school records, medicaI records.

Everything signed, sealed, delivered?

Everything proceeds as planned.
Nothing changes.
Just stick to the plan
Things are going exactly as planned.
We stick to the plan. Nothing changes.
You will do what I tell you,
Things were going well.
As you asked.
And then move right on into your daily goal list.
We do everything by the book.
Like in the deal.
We followed procedure.
I take it everything went as planned.
They were at the sharpest state of readiness, right on schedule.
Do this by the book. No mistakes.
It's back to business as usual. Yeah.
Let's follow all protocoIs on this.

Everything was going according to plan.
It's all going to plan, but not a single eagle has been seen,
We're on schedule. Good.
It's getting done, Sid.
Keep going. Back to the plan.
It was all very logical.
And we'll do it official,
I follow the code. The stalk was good.

And nothing but the truth so help you God?
And nothing but the truth so help your God? Yes.

All that stirs up the lees of things. - wake up!
Order up.
All good.
I've got it when we killed the cop today
All is well here, he writes.
It's all worked out. Nina and I are gonna have dinner Thursday.
Uh... All set. The boat is ready for us.
You are all set, my friend.
We fixed everything. Good as new.
That's my operation.
With all the changes, exactly as you ordered.
Things change, Mary.
Much has changed.
A place for everything,
Everything's covered here.
And go in peace.
Vital signs are stable.
And after we've gotten you settled,
Every document, every bank statement, all of it.
Every file, every project.
The cynosure of all things civilized:
On which all civilisations rested, writing.
It's irrefutable
In this apartment anyway.
All is well! He was too weak to stand up.
Everything's fine. I checked.
Nobody come, nobody go.
Everything was great, and then you just dump me out of the blue?
There's nothing we can do.
He is much too late! What should he regret about, dad?
And then all the useless things fall away,
But nothing impressed me at all. I never expected it to
Everything that didn't make sense to log into evidence.
Symbolic ritual, nothing more.
Let bygones be bygones. All around.
Was all that was needed.
Everything old is new again.
Everything old can be new again.
Everything North of San Francisco.
It was designed a long time ago.
Where the answer comes before the question.
It's all mapped out. don't you understand?
It's all been predetermined by mathematical probability,
Plans have been set in motion.
And when it comes out, it can set you free.
Everything? Yes.
Everything is a very big word. What do you mean?
It started three months ago in Budar.
Is it too late?
We maximize for capture.
Everything meaning what? Me?
That's how it started - an international crisis.
It all started when Dracula was murdered.
It started last night, around midnight.
That this will be worth it.
WouId everything be all right?
Is it everything you imagined?
Would it be the same?
Did everything go according to plan?
Everything? Yeah.
So peaceful.
How it all went away so fast.
To think it was that amazing,
Such harmony is in immortal souls.
How does it end?
I started this, Pete.
I'm the one who has to say those things.
There's a reason.
There are rules.
This all began because a man came over here to save a boy
Or fade like a picture on a silver screen
This is how it started.
Then all of a sudden,
Then all of a sudden, ''l love you.''
Everything wasn't enough.
Everything looked really nice and everything was picked up.
Approaches the unreal
I figured it made sense building me a fence
It was tough, but she did a great job.
Seems pretty open and shut.
All studied, all practiced,
This is obviously just beginning.
Every indication says I'm fine. Thanks.
Everything looks great.
Everything appears normal... Blood pressure, reflexes.
Everything's steady, same as it's always been.
Anything that could indicate I wasn't being truthful.
All better?
It was bad.
All there ever was, always will be,
Everything that had been in the room.
It all used to be so simple, everything.
Everything in boxing is backwards.
That everything in boxing is backwards.
Any and all evidence of prior rape accusations will not be introduced.
Everything we got on the case is in this room.
Everything is sealed and done that else leans on the affair.
In all things pertaining to this extraordinary development.
Legal information you may need for your defence.
All the things that had to converge for the Mets to win the world series.
Anything that points to criminal activity.
This has the potential to change everything.
Anything that explodes, pops, squirts or boings.
And everything came back to me.
Everywhere where they've dug for major utility junctions.
That mommy would take care of everything.
All will marvel upon privileged entry,
Anything with any meaning,
I'm here.
I got everything, all right? don't worry.
You can count on me.
Mama's got you covered.
There's me, Chiang Yiang
All abilities a girl could demonstrate as well as a boy.
We're right on schedule. Will you stop?
Everything was in place, and then they backed away.
Anything they valued, money, guns - it'll be hidden.
Well, there's no shortage of wholesome entertainment.
All freethinking women.
Everything about Rhea is a lie.
All friends shall taste the wages of their virtue,
Did anything under orders.
By now it's all been said and done.
Nothing has changed.
Nothing's changed, okay?
It wasn't supposed to go down like this.
Nothing is supposed to be like this.
This was how it was always meant to be.
Everything was supposed to be perfect.
If he just stayed lonely and pathetic.
It would've been fine.
Why wouldn't everything be okay, hmm?
Everything would have changed anyway.
That's the way it was.
And it would have been fine.
It is unfortunate that it had to happen with everything going so well.
You know, everything was fine. I was happy!
It always seemed so far away.
You know, everything was fine until she spent the night at your place.
Everything was going smoothly
It should have been perfect.
It was a wrap, son! It was a wrap!
All power to all people, man, that's what it's saying.
We have consented to all terms of reason.
It ain't easy.
It's happening fast very fast.
And... It just happened really fast
It's just everything was happening so fast, and.
Everything happened quickly, I guess I forgot he was back there.
It all happened so fast. That guy - the - what guy?
It all happened really fast.
I think it's all happening too fast.
It seemed too easy.
There's no chance to think, to prepare.
And that's how quick it can happen and how serious it is.
It all happened so fast, it was great.
Until the unthinkable occurred.
And it all happened so fast.
Everything is from God, and of God.
Everything comes from the earth.
Well, it's too latefor all that.
I told you this would happen.
It's suddenly clear.
All nuclear fusion is breaking down. How is that possible?
Working from the last census.
There's nothing left to do.
It ends now.
Things are a little easier
It's all going according to plan.
I'm working on that, too.
It's all happening. - tour's starting.
It's pregnant.
Everything was just as Eva told it.
Just like I imagined. You mean.
And just like I thought,
The plan has gone as you had promised, my Lord.
All right? Fine.
Clear!
Everything is in order.
We're... Good.
Everything's fine. Everything's fine. It's cool.

Cool breeze, he's all in.

Nothing's wrong, but something is definitely wrong.
Everything is fine. You cann't fall.
Everything's fine. You shouldn't be in here.
Is everything alright, you jerk?
Everything's all right, so you can just go back into your room and play.
Everything's fine. You're dreaming.
Everything seems to check out, okay with you?
All's quiet, sir.
Everything is fine, sir. Please excuse me.
Everything went fine. Perfect with Nathan.
That is looking good, down a half.
Coast clear? All set.
We're all right. don't worry.
Everything's fine. don't worry. I'll be back in a moment.
Everything's fine. don't worry. Really?
Everything's fine. Relax. Relax, darling. Everything's fine.

Positive. Object in transit.
But "everything's okay "message sent.
Everything works, just not at the right time,
Everything's fine, he's just got a couple of calIs to make.
Everything is fine. Just a little case of PMS. That's all.
No problem, Mr. Spock. Bear with me.

Nothing abnormal.
Everything's fine. Go on back inside.
All's well. Misty weather.
Everything's okay. Son of a bitch.
All right, I think, my lady. Though Mr Carson's a bit cast down.
All good, chief. Yeah?
Everything's okay, ma 'am.
Nothing unusual, but the poor girl was so afraid of losing her baby
Everything's fine. Good.

Affirmative. We're approaching the elevator right now on my left.
Everything's Copa. We're just waiting for you.
Everything's fine.We just need to be left alone right now.
Pilot: sounds good. We'll plan our free - fall deployment to the water.

It's all clear down below. - catch much today?
Oh it's fine, slow. I'm glad we're only a quarter - full.
Perfect. New work in progress, chapter 1.
Understand.
Uneventful. - yeah?
Everything's normaI? Yes.
Is everything okay? Yeah.
Everything's fine. Good night.
Fleet's quiet, no enemy contact for the last ten days.
You're fine, miss Lang. Nothing to worry about.
It is clear. I'll gonna pop back
Coming through fine, Jack.
Everything's fine, we'll puII out.
Nothing fancy. Mother, think.

Everything okay? Yeah, fine.
Everything's fine.It's all good. You found me.
Everything's good. It's all right, sir.

All signal, no noise. Pristine.
Nothing out of the ordinary? He's been himself.
We're good. Bathroom's clear, sir.
It's wonderful... And that pulley!
Suspecting nothing, and ghosts. Ghosts.
Everything checks out, less than a week.
All goes well, we'll recover the painting tomorrow.
Nothing out of the ordinary until I found this.
All clear. Over and out.
Nothing going on, as usual.
Nothing unusual, except she seemed very happy and relaxed.
Pretty much normal. Liver function tests are good.
Everything's fine. The fetus is healthy and growing,
Green lights across the board, captain.
Everything's gonna be fine. Just get them ready.
It's all clear. - nobody is going to get into that beast.
It's okay. I want you to breathe with me. Listen, listen, listen.
All systems are go. The trajectory is okay.
Everything is operational. The emergency system is rerouting power.
Situation normal, all fucked up.
Everything's good. It's just a status check.
We're good to go.

Nothing unusual, except them singing, sir.
All clear. Raymond.
Well, everything seems fine. But I can call the doctor if you'd like.
Everything's good and wonderful. We gotta go. Good bye.
To know that we're on course, first of all for earth orbit,
The plan is proceeding as expected. - Oh, really?
It's all working out just as I thought.
Make no mistake
It's pregnant.
And all goes worse than I have power to tell.
Anything. - absolutely anything.
There should be no competition.
As crude as ever
And when that happens, we look like geniuses.
You've been cleared of all wrongdoing.
That's how I felt right after everything went down.
the entire rest of eternity spent in fucking Bruges!
Everything, please.
Everything's okay. No, it's not.
Everything's okay. Go back to bed. It's late.
Everything okay? Everything is fine.
Everything okay? Oh, yeah.
Everything's fine. Great.
it's all good, alright
Something no one would ever have dreamt of.
No different.
Nothing has to happen.
Sandstorms wreak havoc on anything
Everything. No lies, no secrets, nothing.
Everything we Didn't do.
hasn't spoiIt it, has it?
That it wouldn't be so rough.
It's not that simple. Instead, you were more concerned
Okay, so we'll go to Bravo.
Is everything alright?
Is everything all right? That's a pretty stupid question to ask, Jeff.
Is everything okay? - okay?
Everything will be OK. It's OK.
Everything's destined for failure.
Everything would shut down.
All creatures great and small
Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.
That flows through all living things.
And all the blood will not have been in vain.
All his precautions up in smoke.
When it's dead and gone
All that matters is the truth, and you don't have it.
Everything's off the record.
Things have been dark for too long
Everything deep loves masks. What are you thinking?
Given everything that's happened.
The chaos fades away and you see the discipline, the balance of restraint and abandon.
So predictable so confused
All clear and bye bye.
Everything comes into focus.
That had all turned out to be untenable.
Whatever he chooses to be whatever he wills.
It began 12 years ago.
It's all about the "like".
All that anger.
Everything starts in here.
Off the land, man nature's bounty is abundant
This is all going on subtly, often hidden within these communities.
A mean little mound of ashes
The whole thing goes away.
Everything else just fades away. All your troubles -
The whole thing was incredibly cathartic.
Hear that brass band playing in the gazebo.
 all that matters, dear is where you're coming from
Makes everything else fade away.
Everything by the book.
We'll do anything you say, but we sure would appreciate liquor money for tonight.
Whatever you say there, dr. Simms.
We'll proceed as planned
As usual.
Things worked. Trains ran on time.
Nothing out of the ordinary. Is that clear?
Proceed as arranged, and you can tack another zero onto your fee.
And you're gonna do exactly what I say, then there'll be no problems.
End of story.
It always does.
Nothing's changed?
Same thing, ain't it?
Same old, same old, they just keep getting richer.
It's always the same, you know?
It's business as usual. Suspension's lifted.
Well, nothing's changed. She gives the orders.
Everything's normal, she looks great,
A routine call, right? Exactly.
Just like old times, ain't it?
The way things were before all this.
Planets aligned. It was a good day. Right?
Everything was fine. It was normal.
Nothing changes. We take down the company.
Like everything else. I'll look into it.
All is right with the world.
Entries closed July 31st.
Are we go?
All's going to plan.
From everyone, just everything.
And destroys everything in its path.
Everything and everybody.
The whole package.
All just special effects put on by a very gifted showman.
Anything out of the ordinary
It will all have been for nothing.
And everything I ever hope to be.
Right now.
Anything that happens, happens within nature,
Every little thing.
Disintegration of everything into a fiery void.
Every facet of our lives,
All that is best in life.
All life has long since ceased to exist
That we inherently have as sentient, free, conscious beings.
All life must be judged.
All lives end,
Everything you'd need for life contained within this store.
All lives end in suffering and tragedy.
Every organism has its place in nature;
Any organism that reproduces by spreading itself over the largest area possible,
All creatures need an incentive to perform tasks.
Everything you need for printing counterfelt money.
And everything he did to win construction bids - extortion, bribes, threats -
All because one human cursed another.
The choice is his.
He's the man in charge.
He's responsible for everything.
So what you do is up to you.
I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best.
But it's up to you.
I'll make it all up to you
It's only for you to decide,
You make the choices, decide what, where, and when.
It's entirely up to you, Harry.
Up to you, kiddo. Yeah.
Your call, captain. I'm just here to consult.
You arrange
It starts with you.
Whatever you think is safest.
You are in total control, okay?
And you will get one for me.
Well, that depands on your judges.
It's your choice.
Everything is up to force
Any intercept will be handled by special forces.
Run by the ground master computer here in the firing room.
Let the grownups do their jobs; okay?
That all started with a big bang
We'll leave it up to her.
That's when it all began. The town went schizo.
Just with my attitude, baby.
I'm in charge of it all.
It's totally up to me. She is so great. I miss her.
We will take what we wish, then decide whether to blow up your ship.
That's up to me. I cann't wait for him to respond to the blog.
I started it.
This started with me. It ends with me.
I'll take care of it. You know nothing.
I'll take all the responsibility
I'll account for everything.
I'll deal with it, okay?
All starting from friendship.
That's how it started.
It begins with growing "blanks".
The evidence explains. - then help me find some evidence.
And electronic devices from their cases
Then the pain will go away.
That's the narural position of nature.
All that pain and trauma.
About all of it -
All - all of it.
In all of this,
It all.
They even gave him the throne.
It's just been about getting my mom to love me.
Just the size of everything.
All of that.If there's anything I can do -
And everything becomes chaos
Like everything. You're elght years old and like you had a house burning down,
Everything, I seriously went to another planet.
all in all. I feel pretty good about myself.
Houses, cars, theaters, restaurants, even the people -
Everything, this whole food chain, is fed by the flowering plants.
The, you know, the whole thing. Oh, yeah.
Everything. He simply couldn't stand the idea that there were elements in the world that he couldn't order around.
Everything! All right?
None of this would have happened.
All happening simultaneously.
You know, happening simultaneously.
everything will fall apart.
Thank you for everything.
Leave it all behind.
Everything, get me data. Right.
It's all a question of balance.
And all of it, lovey - dovey.
That it's all for nothing.
Everything goes boom with it
Everything everywhere seems to get worse and worse,
This has all been a big mistake.
That kind of confirmed everything.
This is the beginning for everything.
I rest my case, your honor.
Nothing is turning out the way I thought it would.
Everything except you.
Everything you see, all of it, really, is her.
All sorts of things.
It's kind of like that "tree falling in the forest" thing.
Everything depends upon the element of surprise.
Is it possible that the mind is all that matters,
It'd be worth the risk.
It happened overnight.
It all happened for a reason.
This is happening because they left.
All programmed options,
Big gay al, and all gays, into their club!
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.
Everything's in the bag? Yeah.
All sounds, the oboe, the flute praise you.
For all its quirks and criminals.
Everything's o - come over here and give your man a big kiss.
And it all started when I dropped that grant application into that mailbox
The whole of existence is in jeopardy right now.
It could all be taken away.
All that emotion... It wipes you out.
Everything meaning.
Everything feels different.
All pomp and Majesty I do forswear;
It all begins with the controls.
Directly to the source.
The source of all, the monster's power,
The greatest hits.
That all that other stuff, that it's all over.
All reality, all life merges into a sign
All the love and familiarity are gone
Physical illness - Oh, thank you - is - is due to some, you know, mental weakness.
All the craziness, the partying, the sex, the drinking, it sounds incredible.
All the rest of the symptoms can be explained by a severe long - term allergic reaction.
Everything I've studied and learned will be yours
Everything bad that has happened, you bring.
The science of it all beguiled her.
All will be revealed in time. I promise.
All will be revealed in time.
All roads lead back to the same simple, sad fact.
The end of everything.
All your sins can be forgiven
The glory belongs to Allah.
All these cuts, the reconfiguring,
The responsibility and possibility.
I'll pay for the bill
Any and all resources are at your fingertips.
Hey, all this started because you people lied to us.
And the source of all,
What started all of this was the 35 years
Believable that they seem to leap off the page.
An end in itself.
It was worth it,
Trusted to run it all.
It will answer everything. I promise.
That will solve everything! I've had it!
That will solve everything! I've had it!
All repose, all balance is only relative.
When each refinement
They thought of you and me
And all to challenge the system.
Image is everything.
All wounds heal.
It's controlled by arcangel de Jesus Montoya.
Nothing left unimagined.
All things are possible.
 and you're the reason why.
Everything that is is because of you.
That it all started with a cosmic impact
This all began with me.
Thus shall it be done to the man in whom the king delights to honor.
Term of endearment.
For the purpose of causality violation.
It's a controlled environment.
Just say the word.
Everything inappropriate and foolish
And seeing things in a dream.
This is where it all starts.
Everything was falling into place.
Everything goes in cycles.
It all turns on a dime.
Nothing but love, love, love.
All is as God wilIs it.
There will be nothing.
All is vanity.
It's all about relationships.
All is possible.
Anything can happen
Anything is possible!
Anything was possible.
Everything was possible,
All is possible - everything.
Nothing is beyond our means and nothing is too much trouble.
Anything is possible, right?
Anything can happen, right? I'll get the hospital.
Anything is possible. - what, you think I'm out of my depth?
Well, it can happen. It nearly killed him.
Anything could be done, but it only is done if it's done.
Way over in the back! You, little guy!
Anything is possible, you know.
Anything can happen, sir.
Not impossible... Just a bit unlikely.
Nothing's impossible. If it can be dreamed, it can be done.
Everything is possible. Even the impossible.
It could mean anything, Mr. Donner.
Every flight ends in a crash.
Possibilities are endless, man.
Could be anything. All right, stop it.
The possibilities are endless, right?
Anything's possible, right?
Anything is possible! Come on!
But nothing's impossible. If we messed it up, we can clean it up.
All is possible - everything. Anything.
Anything can happen, hmm?
Lots of possibilities Yep. You never know.
It's possible. Yes? Or no?
Anything's possible, even Santa Claus. Why?
Anything is possible.
Anything is possible, unless you quit.
Everything happens for a reason.
There is an appointed time for everything,
It all has a purpose. I don't know.
There are no coincidences.
Everything is connected.
Everythings unknown, there is no recipe.
It all comes back to love.
 that all started with a big bang
It all starts in the mind.
Everything is made of energy. Albert elnsteln -
All people's worries are all thanks to this crazy heart
All because I was standing in an elevator in Tokyo.
And nothing is as I wished.
You never wished for this.
Precision is all, mum.
Everything. For now.
Everything that matters has been destroyed. We're good to go.
And all relevant files to our custody.
Everything across the board.
So everything seemed quiet there? Real cozy.
Looked like a shoo - in. So easy.
Well, everything seems normal.
Everything seemed just fine and dandy.
Everything that seems clear is bent. And everything that seems bent is clear.
All seemed well.
Everything looks so good, feels so good.
Everything looks just great, actually.
Well, everything still looks fine.
Everything looks correct, but look at the auto - update in the defauIt setting.
It all seems too good to be true.
Everything's looking really good.
Everything seemed so perfect.
Everything seems to fail
And everything will look like it will be okay.
Everything looks fine. Right on track for 23 and a half weeks.
Everything looks fine. Let's say so.
Everything seemed on the up and up.
Nothing seemed out of place. But I don't know,
Everything appears to be fairly random
And everything looks gray... The nurses, the flowers, blood.
Everything seemed to go as planned.
And everything seems like it's going really well.
Everything is so tall and grand.
It's like nothing happened.
Everything totally credible - devoid of human error.
all seems fine, the ship sets sall
It's up to you, Marcellus.
I was disheartened by what I saw and heard.
Everything looks clear,
everything looks good.
Everything looks good going over the hill. Good luck, guys.
Everything looks okay.
And already this in line
Everything looks good.
Nothing's wrong, except there's nothing wrong.
Everything looks okay. We're ready to beam over.
It all seemed so easy back then.
Anything look funny to you... Anything... You blast away.
It all looked legit.
You know, and everything looks so great.
It seemed... So simple.
So, you know, everything looks great.
Everything appears normal.
Everything is better. Everything looks better, feels better.
It all seemed so natural.
So everything looks fine.
did everything seem normal?
There was seemed to never end, and we had one more mouth to feed. Erik.
Everything looks so beautiful.
Everything appears real,
Everything looks so nice too.
Things almost feel like they're back to normal.
It all seems so normal, a little too normal.
Everything looks so expensive.
Everything looks very good.
Everything looks fine. Really?
Everything seemd calm.
And everything looks cheap. You were charming.
All seems well.
And everything seemed okay?
And everything was happy.
It looked like it was working until the "doctor" vanished,
Everything looks fine.
Everything seems normal.
Looks the same, smelIs the same, feels the same.
Everything seems wet and cold,
And all this looks quite nominal.
Everything seems to be fine now.
Everything looks the same.
And everything seemed fine,
Yeah, everything looks good. Everything at school good?
Everything seems to be working perfectly.
And it all seems so perfectly reasonable doesn't it?
It all seems so perfect.
Everything looks so glum.
Everything feels so wonderful.
Everything seems perfectly fine
Everything seems perfectly fine until we move into the chest cavity area.
Looks the same. SmelIs the same. Feels the same.
Everything is so unique, but it all works.
Everything was fucking fine, Lorraine.
This is so last minute.
This is really how it is.
Everything is fine. Totally.
So perfect! Everything. You're such a cold, heartless, smug bitch!
All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered.
This is actually happening, and I'm blowing it.
 is that all you really want? # - no, no, no
It's true that some things are better left unsaid.
Everything's gonna be really good from now on, okay?
Everything is truly beautiful
 and things aren't looking very good, it's true
It actually does.
It was bad, really bad.
Is this thing really over?
Disclosure smoke and mirrors.
When the truth is found to be lies
Everything is covered up.
Everything moves so fast.
Everything about this guy says he did it.
The root of all knowledge.
All knowledge is a double - edged sword.
Everything. You know?
Questions to make sure we're providing a safe and healthy environment for you.
This is all confirmed?
I did start the scandal.
That it was all their fault.
All undetected, then we might have a fight on our hands.
All the sacred spirits.
Everything you need to know about the mysterious and the unexplained.
Quiet on all fronts.
It was all pretty good.
Everything was moving so fast. So fast.
It was all legitimate.
VitaIs appear stable.
And things were steady. Things were good.
The thing was stable and then it disappeared.
Well, she's stable, so soon as she wakes up,
How did that happen?
How is that ever gonna happen?
All available doctors and security personnel to the E.R. Immediately.
It's all happening really quickly.
Suddenly seemed very dear to me
Suddenly everything became clear.
Makes it all real.
And suddenly things felt different.
It suddenly stopped.
Take control right away and keep it going.
Until you hit the three - month mark.
My big pay off better be worth it. Samantha, I don't understand you.
Whole thing comes crumbling down.
Let's talk about the marriage after my son's return.
Promise you won't tell her until I'm back home.
This is full of answers.
All the answers are in that house.
I mean, all strategy changes mean? You know what?
It was a complete nightmare.
Faster than you can say, "fetch," it brings me great delight
And so forth.
All systems normal, Houston.
where I'm no fun anymore
Twisted every way, what answer can I give?
A fortunate coincidence for all involved.
Everything points in the same direction.
It was all about the car in the end.
Bottom line is the trail leads me to you and your company. I want to know the truth!
This is where it all leads.
Everything points to the fact that
Everything is traceable back to Mickey
All the little things.
Details, route, just a different date.
The nuances are just too similar.
Everything fits: the coast guard report.
We'd agreed on everything up to the last detall.
It's finally clear
I'm just glad that it's over.
So this... So this is finally over.
This finally makes sense.
Everything's finally starting to work out.
Oh, we're done.
Everything turns out all right
The time will come and you, my dear,
Thy will be done.
And everything shall be as it was.
Your rainbow will come smiling through
Everything will turn out alright.
This is all going to come apart.
All things end in judgment.
Shadows and dust.
Nothing stays buried forever.
That's always going to be true.
So everything ended well after all.
when it was over,
Keep lady Essex here until it is all over.
When it was all done,
When this is all over.
When you're finished.
And when it was all over, God cast the rebels into perdition.
After all this is over, she's still gonna forgive you.
And if by the end of it we still like each other, then maybe it's the real thing.
We'll probably have sex afterwards.
Done?
Full stop.
It's all over. Get down here.
It's over. You'll be pleased.
You must be relieved that it's over.
It's all over, all over. back off!
So it's over?
So it's over. Yeah.
It's over. She's gotta go.
It's over. Bring him up.
It's over, drop it!
It's behind me now. And that's all I care about.
After all this gets over
When this is over, are you coming back?
When all this is over, I'm going to find her.
What do you do When it's all over?
We're done. You can go back home. No hard feelings. One week.
don't bother calling me to come back until it's all over.
One final loose end to tie up before putting all this behind me.
And when it's over.
When this is all over, there will be no more Jews in Alexandria.
When you're done here, your memories will be wiped and you'll be able... Doctor?
When it is over, what happens with your life?
You've got a life to go back to at the end of this.
Some of the sweetest moments come when the job ends
We'll find you when is clear.
When all this is over I'll come back for you, I swear.
I'll be doing better once this is over.
I feel somehow I'll just keep going on even after it's over, like Hillary.
I'll make it up to her after this is all over.
I'll come for you when it's over.
And when it's done, I disappear into the night, knowing you are forever mine.
When it was over I thanked her.
After this is over, I go back to prison.
As soon as this is all over, I'm gonna find you. OK? I promise.
When this is over, my men get to drink for free!
When this is all over, you can arrest me all you want,
When it was officially over, he left.
Call me when it's over. all right.
We'll come back when it's over.
We'll see who's got an Academy when this is over.
And in the end when its over all that matters is what you have done.
And in the end, when it's over, all that matters is what you've done.
And after this thing is said and done, it might be the only place that survives.
Everything came back completely normal.
Everything. Give me the car key, please.
Nothing's by accident. Exactly.
It all started a week ago.
All offences, my Lord, come from the heart.
Everything that was beautiful, has become ugly.
Every location beautiful in a way.
Everything that is good,
The enemy of everything that is good,
She was all of those things, and now she's gone.
Everything is beautiful. There's nothing to worry about.
Perfect relationships end in ruin.
To have good things and a good life.
We have the whole world right in... Right in front of us.
Beautiful things die in tree hill.
And hope for the good within us all
The beginning of everything great.
All good things come to those who can
All this is great. It touched every moment of her life,
Best thing I did was go.
Yeah, that was cool.
Everything is the same. He was wondering about you.
Lord Grantham will decide what's to be done.
Everything! - and you loved it.
Contact you've called and password you've used.
All things wise and wonderful
Everything began after we started experimenting with radiation.
But whatever can be done for your comfort will be done.
What I will need to win my war.
Anything and everything. Got it
Whatever can go wrong will go wrong.
And everything would go back to the way it was before I drove a wedge between them.
All that sets men in motion
Anything that'll help us figure out what he was up to.
Anything that could help us find her.
Anything that might help us track her.
Anything smuggle - able, I smuggle, all right?
Anything that might give us a clue.
You scrap anything that they can use against you.
Everything about me invites you in,
Any thing that makes sick it.
That what is good for the goose, is good for the philanderer
I want all available units out looking for her.
Anything smuggle - able, I smuggle.
This is all gonna work itself out. No need to rush into anything.
God has fixed everything.
The ways of God in nature, as in providence, are not our ways.
There is a natural order to things, and by the time they go, you're ready.
And a time to every purpose under the heaven.
Then it'll all make sense.
Things have just been working out.
And then, all this.
It went okay.
All in good time, my dear.
That's the makings of every great relationship.
It all comes down to a matter of trust,
If it ends, it ends.
Haven't seen the end of it yet
To whatever drugs he wants.
The phoney must die, says" the catcher in the rye ".
Every action has its consequence.
The instructions are to engage only on my command.
All must be done as one.
Nothing will change operationally.
Every movement will be under protocol "escape and evade".
This has to be kept quiet.
Everything will be run through NSA. Who controls faheen?
Cann't make a decision unless the computer gives you the go - ahead.
Soon it will be too late.
He's manipulating the grid.
Anything else that's got frostbitten, particularly your manhood, might swell.
Everything that was taken from us.
@ answers still are left behind @
And those memories are locked deep in your mind,
Everything, swallowed by the whale.
It all started 27 years ago.
Well... It all started with ice cream.
It all started a few weeks ago.
It all started ten years earlier.
Had to learn everything again.
Yeah, it all started about two months before we got married.
It started with my father, gently proudbeast.
It's kind of like starting at square one.
It ends today.
I've moved on. You should do the same.
It'll have to happen in, what, five seconds?
So you all have to be careful
after investigators recelved a tip from an informant,
If only it were that easy, right?
It has to be different, you must adapt to changing times.
I'm only as good as whatever happens next season.
Everything depends on God.
All the tumblers clicking into place.
All to convince us that he was unbeatable.
Everything's amping up. Yeah?
It had to end like this.
Were amenable to mathematics - the architectural ones,
We'll know.
It's all going to hell.
Made sense of everything.
Nothing is planned without my approval.
Whole thing's gone down the toilet.
Whatever's got you so scared.
Everything that made it good
Let it go.
For how to get this film made by the end of the day.
I got everything.
And everything you know is gone.
The facility and the A.I. Are interconnected only to the extent
Any sort of evidence will answer.
All the evidence now points to
And traces of paint under his nalls indicate that the kid tried to escape.
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.
Everything points to Olivia.
Any evidence that's here is gone.
Evidence will go into a banker's box and be filed away,
Any curse can be broken.
And it is exactly as was rumored.
 all those words
That'll be enough of that.
This is about family.
This was supposed to be over.
The whole darn shooting match could go over tea kettle.
Nothing has to change.
Let's finish this now.
I'm so happy that we cleared that up.
All the misunderstandings will be cleared.
Things weren't adding up.
Uh, "any" is kind of a broad word.
Bigotry is boring when we add modifiers.
All will be unmasked.
And everything is laid bare.
We have the how and the why, now we just need the who.
Thanks for everything.
It was like I was in one of his movies.
All possums go to heaven.
Everything's in my name... Always was.
I'll accept the responsibility. Just turn off the lights!
And how I account for every penny.
Consider your stay on us.
Everything. Paid for the operation. It cost you?
The boxing Commission's paying for all this. Everything.
Everything!
Look, I've got everything right here.
You'll have every means at your disposal,
Grab everything! Hit the junkyards! Take apart the cars!
That would be gone,
All praise to Allah.
Everything! Get out!
Everything must be this way
This is all because Scott doesn't want to go to college.
It began in a time
It all started when she told me.
Anything outside the natural order is.
They should stay up long enough for the job.
Everything you look for in a footballer, he's got.
It's not quite what you expected, huh?
This has got nothing to do with you.
it happened just like you said it would.
Everything about anything alien, he's supposed to know.
Everything's just like we discussed
Nothing has changed around here
That follows the prophecy,
Leave... Hey, leave Mac out of this.
It'll work against all small - arms ammunition,
Turn back reverse return
All that hard work, all that had been achieved,
It was over quickly.
You were what remained when it had passed.
Everything that is and was and will be, is everywhere.
Things do seem to be running quite smoothly. Exactly.
Status is good.
Looking good to us, over.
To go all the way around! When everything's so close.
How's it going ?
And everything would be like old times?
Could it be worse
And everything will be just the way it was.
Will it be the same?
Nothing's changed since I was a boy.
Nothing will be different.
It's just the same!
It's still happening.
Everything's under control, sir. Our units are in position. Go time is ten minutes.
It's an ongoing investigation.
It's on its way.
And everything went well.
Doing all right?
Sometimes is everything okay?
No permanent damage here, chairman.
Everything alright? Yes, he's asleep. I just checked.
how's everything? You need anything? What can I do for you?
Any luck, Michael?
Everything looks good, but, uh, we'll - we'll talk to the attending before we go.

How are you? You guys do your macho things?
Is everything okay? You seem a little distracted.
Everything all right? Are you all right?

Is everything okay? Yeah.

Everything okay, Bobby?
Everything all right? Yeah, sure.
Well, that went well. Yeah.
Everything all right? No, it's not all right.
It's all right, I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you. I got you.
Everything all right? It's fine. It's all fine.
Everything's satisfactory, I hope, Mr Tulkinghorn?
Everything will continue.
he still covered his bets.
So everything... Is exactly the same. Nothing changed.
Everything is just as normal and boring as it's ever been.
The situation is still in control.
Is not knowing.
It's still not over.
Everything will go on as before.
The judges laid down the law.
Everything is still a little blurry.
Nothing had changed.
Nothing's changed. You have to trust that.
If we all just come clean.
The whole thing remains mysterious.
It's still coming through.
Which remained a mystery.
Everything... One takeover is still left.
There's much to be learned still,
This might not be a dead end. He's got may.
Nothing is set, honey.
You know, nothing's a sure thing.
Nothing's been confirmed. They probably don't know themselves yet.
It's not over yet.
it's still not over
It isn't finished. Oh yes, it's finished.
You may already be Cho's bride.
Is everything okay? He's not sick, is he?
Is everything okay here?
Is everything all right? - yeah, everything's fine.
He's not done yet.
He hasn't finished what he started.
We're not out of this yet. Captain, orders!
Because it's... Not set in stone.
You Haven't seen anything, yet.
Listen, nothing's definite so don't say anything.
And it wasn't over yet.
This is not over.
It's not over. - what?
It's not over! Do you hear me?
This doesn't have to be the end. You have a choice.
Fo this ain't over.
It's not over yet. Well, that's just it.
Everything was to your satisfaction?
Normal, normal.
So everything went okay here?
It's all good, man
Life goes on. It's a competition.
We don't know everything yet. It's still with the D.A.
This is far from over.
Is everything all right? You tell me.
Everything's cool, right?
Everything was great. It was good.
Is everything taken care of?
Did everything go smoothly?
how's everything?
Everything OK? Yes.
Everything cool? Kid stinks.
Everything all right, agent?
All going smoothly?
How'd everything go here? Oh, yeah. Good. Great.
Hey, is everything okay? Yeah, ye, Sir.
Everything OK? Yep.
So, you made it down. Yeah, of course.
Is everything cooI? Well, you see, sir.
Things were going so good, I almost felt white.
The starting point begins with the ILM art department.
Anything, just charge it, this is not necessary,
The way everything works. Mathematics.
Everything was going so well.
Things are happening fast, and we have to be ready.
And how'd that work out?
Everything's just working out so perfectly.
Everything should go smoothly.
You were scrambling to get up to speed.
And I cann't imagine it having gone any better.
This is going very well.
Things are going great for me up there, I don't want him screwing it up.
Things are kind of going okay.
And this was going so well.
Yeah, it's going really, really well.
Just, everything's going really great.
Everything is going very well.
And everything was cool.
Everything goes with a swing
Everything's taken care of, but I'm reluctant to talk on the phone.
Everything good there?
Things went well for and we kids Didn't have to give up on our dreams.
Things were going great, but after a few hours, their... Pulses started to spike.
Everything OK? yeah, I - listen.
Everything was going so well. I had to say something.
Things are going really well, so I Didn't want to see you.
Everything's going smoothly and the eclipse hasn't even kicked in yet.
Everything all right? Yeah, everything is fine.
Everything's gonna be okay. That's what we saw, right?
All goes well, and I'll call with his location.
Everything was going along fine until three months ago,
Yeah, everything went to plan until new York's finest showed up.
Things are going okay
And it all worked out quite well.
It went really smoothly.
So how's everything going? Fine.
Everything's working out.
And that went so well,
So how's everything going?
Everything is proceeding well.
And everything seemed to be going so well.
Everything going as it's supposed to?
Everything's going fine.
It works and you have to have a bunch of sex?
In all probability, he's dead like them.
Well, all indications are everybody is safe.
And all indications point to their being swept with the tide.
All the omens point to him.
All the symptoms are consistent with poisoning.
Everything said that he was gonna be there and.
Everything points to a solitary existence.
Nothing but the best
All communications are terminated.
All communications are down.
Everything would beabcdrifting apart.
Everything that was go and hidden to light.
The whole of creation would change forever.
The logical signs point to suicide, don't they?
Anything you say.
Their faith put in praxis. Praxis?
I felt terrible.
Naturally, expressing everything
It was so easy,
Everything? The money, the castles, the jewellery?
All that is evil, all that have eyes.
all that is evil, all that have eyes.
Depart, every demonic power.
All could see that they had vanquished the evil.
All evil comes from them. So do the good tings, don't they?
Everything was fully functional except the air bags. They were turned off.
It's gonna be... It's gonna be good.
Things took a turn. It's kind of crazy.
And things will never be the same.
Everything got so screwed up.
That all things will go on as they have before,
I've made my way quite well, actually.
Everything's the same, except one little difference
Everything's the same, except for one change
Everything's duplicated.
I mean, everything is the same.
It's obvious.
The slate could be wiped clean.
Everything has to be just so.
Everything's upside down -
So everything's on track, right?
Everything is coming together as a result.
Everything's on course. Okay. Cadet Lovell.
And everything was... Different.
And things started to change.
And, well, things Haven't been the same
Nothing will ever be the same! Nothing! I'm going now.
This is new, all of this, for the both of us.
And things are changing for me. It's like the era of yes has begun.
Things just - things just seem different.
Everything's different!
Not ever again. Never. Done. Forty.
Nothing is ever going to be okay again.
Everything would be perfect.
It is never gonna happen.
Everything stands.
Nothing's going to change.
Nothing's going to get any better.
None of that's going to change.
Everything is not going to be cool.
None of it would have ever happened.
Have things never change.
Everything is going to be fine.
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay?
Everything's gonna be Justine.
Everything's gonna be all right.
And none of this will have made a blind bit of difference.
Everything will be taken care of.
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.
This will not be in vain!
Nothing ends.
It's all worthless.
Well, it all keeps spinning, spinning round and round
There's nothing you could've done.
There's nothing you could've done. I could've told you the truth.
Never again. I am tired of bending over.
I cann't... Control it all, anymore.
Nothing was a mystery anymore.
None of it makes sense anymore.
Nothing makes sense anymore.
Nothing normal is.
Nothing scares me anymore!
Nothing was out of reach.
And everything doesn't have to be so difficuIt anymore.
It's not good enough. It's a nightmare.
Nothing is going to change.
Nothing I believed made sense anymore.
None of this would have been possible.
And all that became impossible.
nothing's ever gonna be the same.
Everything's different, remember, because the ship's upside down.
Everything's different. Basilio, stay put!
Everything is different, my Lord.
Everything was different. At home everything was different.
Reckless.
It's just absence.
And when that's gone.
This is all wrong. What's wrong?
Everything's getting so uncomfortable.
Everything is not okay.
It can never be right.
everything's not fine. Got it?
Everything's not fine. Got it?
Everything's not all right. These two people cut in front of me.
Things are not turning out as we expected.
It was all pretty convincing,
None of it's easy.
Everything is wrong.
Everything is strange.
Everything's wrong. You're living like a sharecropper.
Everything, man. We were bleeding money.
Nothing's working.
This is not how it's supposed to be!
I don't want you to change anything.
all out of questions?
None of it is.
Nothing is what it seems.
I know it, you know, really wasn't your fauIt or anything.
Nothing is accidental.
And it's not her fault. Actually, you know what?
I Didn't imagine it!
Nothing's like it used to be.
Not that it really matters anymore, does it?
It all went so wrong.
None of this was my decision.
I Didn't mean to do anything!
And none of this is real.
Everything is not so simple. It is something like huge garage.
Everything's wrong. Everything's wrong.
Do not worry everything
Everything was perfect,
Very uncertain.
And nothing is too much trouble.
This is all beyond me.
And we cann't afford to stop now,
Nothing comes out.
There are no guarantees.
Nothing's gonna get in the way or stop me.
Nothing natural about it.
Everything was gone.
It should not have happened.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
None of this matters
Nothing mattered.
doesn't matter, Jimmy.
Nothing else in the world matters right now, Caroline.
Everything's fine, though.
It was all right.
So good, right?
Is every - everything cool?
everything's good and mum's great.
Things are good. I got that coaching job.
Everything's pretty much business as usual.
Which sounds great except she proceeded to punch me in the face.
It isn't necessary that everything is said.
All in harmony with his sadness, and some in praise of dulcinea
It's all turned around on you.
It's all turned around on you. It never will. Suddenly you are old.
It's none of your damn business.
Nothing was as it seemed.
Everything exactly as it was when I had left over four years ago.
It is all about her.
It turns out that it's all to do with the number of electrons
Everything was different.
It was all by the enigma?
Everything's the same as it was.
It's all about speed, isn't it? One thing to another, never standing still.
Nothing looks exactly the way I left it.
This is not about the outfit.
But it was all for one magnificent goal,
It's all been leading up to this.
And asks no omen but his country's cause.
And for the corporations.
Anything for you girl, and since you left the party, I brought the party to you. Hmm?
Everything is about conserving energy.
To protect her.
Anything for the brothers.
Everything for the chiIdren. 50-50.
It is all for charity.
anything for charity, and anything for my man.
A vehicle for my real experiments.
For democracy.
Anything for an old amigo.
Anything and everything for chief.
Anything to keep our attention off her.
Everything is about winning, even in death.
everything is done for you.
And the party's all for me
Justice and equality for all. Take a copy of the proclamation.
Everything's fruity in the loops
Everything's just fucked up.
Everything is so confusing.
It's fucked up, isn't it?
All hell broke loose.
It's all gotten messed up and derailed again.
It was a mess. I had to clean it up.
Everything's gone down the tubes, and no one knows why.
It all went wrong from there. Tears just started to flow.
That was pretty messed up.
And all hell broke loose.
The whole thing. Bloody madness!
Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand!
Everything was crazy. It was in a barn.
Everything got screwed up, and I snapped. And I don't care.
Everything's gone haywire. And it's all your fault!
It was total chaos.
It's a total mess!
Everything's a mess. My queen!
This is so messed up, man!
Nothing is fun.
Tie perfectly knotted.
Everything happens for a reason, right?
That's not how it works.
Everything's connected, right?
And everything's organized.
Everything is in the best of order,
Everything was shipshape. Oh, Frank.
It was all in order. Seals, signatures, everything.
Everything is just as it should be. Thank you, miss.
Everything's under control. How can we help you?
It went pretty well, huh?
Everything is quite in order here, Lord Emsworth.
It is all yours now, do me proud.
It's all yours now. All right, get this thing up!
Left everything to me.
So I can deal with it
You leave everything to me, grasshopper.
It all started with a phone call.
It all began last week. I was sitting in Mrs miggins' coffee shop when.
So, it all started with "the next call of duty" game.
It all began at the Plaza hotel.
Everything started with the disappearance of my uncle.
It all started with my uncle Derek. He was a sergeant in the met.
It all started when the bride asked to see me.
It started with a chair.
Everything that happens is from now on
Everything comes from now.
It begins just one year from the time of the murder.
Where it all begins.
Things go down hill from there.
And it all begins here.
It all started here,
Everything began on that day.
Everything started there.
it all starts with the mail.
Well, it all started when Ricky tried to seduce me.
It was fucked up, right?
Shit's a little off, right?
Everything just fucking happens.
All bleeding coming together.
All bleeding coming together, innit, all bleeding coming together.
It's all bleeding coming together. Innit, Ravi?
It's all gonna bleeding come together, innit?
This is all very exciting.
It's all going to go down.
What's not to like?
It takes your breath away.
Everything feels really comfortable.
Everything seems satisfactory.
there's too much confusion
There's too much confusion
Everything is bomb and glamorous.
We did the whole touchy - feely thing, right?
It's aIways about them. How do you propose to do that?
Only those I hold for my church'st. Peter's church.
It's all in the name of freedom.
And everything revolves around the humble sardine.
Depending on people with whom they stayed for hospitality, for food.
Everything depends on one big battle, just like at marengo.
Everything gonna be.
Everything is OK
You'll be on your way.
Makes a difference.
Everything we knew is a long time ago.
Everything would have been different.
Everything will change.
Nothing will ever be the same.
Everything would change, because then she wouldn't be alone.
Things will be different, I promise.
Things are never gonna be the same. I told her I was an artist.
Well, things are gonna be a little different.
It'll change everything for you.
Everything starts crumbling.
It all goes wrong!
We can end it all.
We can end it all.
Everything will end
It'll all be explained. I promise.
It's all going to work out just fine!
Its name will gradually be erased from our memory
That's where it's all beginning.
It'll be low - key.
This is going to stop.
Everything's going to be just like he said it would be.
It's all going to work out like clockwork.
It's going to turn off,
Everything will be good again real soon. All right.
And we're gonna have everything ready.
It will be done.
There will be nothing left.
That everything is going to be fine.
It's gonna be all right, man. Relax.
It will take everything to the next level.
All in good time, when I'm finished with it.
This is all it'll take.
Nothing is ever going to be the same.
Nothing stays the same.
That is gonna change everything.
Things are never gonna be the same, trust me.
It all turned to crap.
And everything's supposed to be fine and dandy.
And that everything would be okay.
Everything's gonna be all right
Up and it's gonna be different. But it's not.
Everything was gonna be OK, no matter how.
And everything will be right.
Everything's going to be okay, buddy.
Everything will be fine... Oh, no, darling. Naughty choc - y.
Everything's going to be fine, okay?
Everything's going to be fine. Wait. I cann't do this.
Everything will distort, everything will be unquantifiable.
It's gonna be different.
And nothing ever will be the same.
Nothing will ever be the same again.
Everything is going to be great,
It's all gonna go rotten.
It's all going to be very cool.
It's all going to be very cool, I promise.
Everything gets dirty.
~ and chaos it will bring ~
A whole lot easier.
Everything would just be a lot easier
'cause you're only gonna get better
And every day from here on out will get easier, right?
And everything will be as it was before.
It all becomes very civilized.
And all turns to silver glass.
All that will change.
Things change, Mary.
All will be as before.
And things would be just like they were?
Everything's gonna be... Oh, my God!
Everything will be the way it was.
Everything will fall naturally into place.
Things will go back to the way they were.
Things can be just like they were before.
And then everything will go back to normal.
Everything will be back 'to normal'.
Everything is gonna back just the way it was.
Everything's going to be back to normal.
And we shall all be as we were before.
All this would stop getting strange?
Everything's right on track.
It'll all come back to you.
It's going to change everything.
Everything will fall into place.
Everything worked out.
These things just fall away in the face of death
Everything will be taken care of.
Everything can be done well.
It will be undone.
It's gonna be great.
Everything will be very different, won't it?
Things are gonna change.
There is no meaning to any of it.
All hell's going to break loose.
Everything does, sooner or later.
And it just kept getting better.
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything will be Fine
And that'll be okay, because we're gonna know what school she's in,
It's all good. Come on.

It'll all be okay.
And everything starts falling apart.
Things'll be what they are.
Everything will become clear.
And everything you went through just goes away?
I think you'll find everything's in order.
This is gonna go exactly as planned.
Things will be done my way.
It will be all unravel.
I think you'll survive it, miss McKenna
All things must end.
Everything has an end, only the sausage has two.
All that's got to stop.
Everything will be over!
And this'll be over. You can stop hiding.
And everything will be over! Yeah.
Everything slows down, I suppose.
Everything will become natural.
And it'll all be forgotten.
It would all be over for her.
It's gonna be clean.
It'll be cleared up in time.
Everything will burn.
Everything out here was shredded. Yeah, shredded by it.
One way or the other.
And everything is going to work itself out.
That would stop this, now is the time.
And it'll all work out.

It'll all be gone, Ronny. It'll all be gone.
This will pass, Betsy.
This is all going to blow over, and I'll be back in my apartment in days,
It will all work out.
Everything dies. Maybe the saddest death of all is the death of a dream.
Things will just go back to the way they've always been, with a new big brother and a new me.
Everything would be the same
Then the whole cycle can start over again.
It will all start again like when mam died.
It'll come back to you.
It's a new beginning, mom.
Everything's gonna be okay. I can feel it.
Everything just shuts down.
It's going to be great.
It's going to be totally, totally, totally fine.
If you only believe the gypsy
It'll all be great.
He'll be okay, grace. Just hang on there a minute or two.
Everything will go smoothly.

And everything's gonna be just fine. We'll be just fine here.
Everything's gonna be fine, all right? Let's just play what we practiced, all right?
It's okay. It's not a problem.

It will all works out. - great!
Everything goes smoothly, we'll take this crew down.
Everything's gonna work out the way it's supposed to.
Everything will seem like a breeze.
It's going to be fine.
Everything seemed perfectly balanced, perfectly in tune.
Everything seemed more real. The guys in their uniforms.
It's your world and we all just live in it?
And everything that makes you wonder.
Got a confession and everything
Everything is riding on it.
As required by law. You're not going to find anything criminal here.
Everything's right on schedule.
His mission proceeds as planned, Majesty
And relying on you for everything.
Lied on it for everything.
Everything's the same except for one important detail.
Everything's exactly as it was.
They'd just pick up where they left off.
And turns wonderful into shit,
All of it's worth it.
It makes it all worth it. Well, you did it.
Here goes everything.
It'll all be worth it?
Is it worth it?
Congratulations on everything.
All solved.
All came to dead stop.
Nothing's working, sir.
There was no movement, no life.
All that stopped.
Everything just stopped and went pitch black.
And everything stopped like a moment out of time.
Everything stopped working. We weren't prepared.
Everything stopped working.
Everything stopped working.We weren't prepared.
It's been storybook.
Everything felt as familiar as if we'd never been away.
It's all the same.
It'll all be the same. That's what we want, right?
Everything went exactly as you said.
Everything slowly faded into an endless tunnel.
Everything's been, like, right there in front of me,
And everything went just as we plan.
Everything is working out Just the way I told them.
It played out exactly like I said
Everything seems real.
It all feels wrong.
And it's all gone like a dream.
Everything appears real, but it's all been worked out in advance?
Everything was heightened. I have that.
Everything went to damnation.
I have no say in it, Gibbs.
It's so full of erotic imagination. Okay, hold on a sec.
all is bright.
Looking at a world full of question marks,
Nothing makes sense.
All above board now.
It's all above board, guys.
Everything is public record.
It's about race.
It's just about evidence.
That it's all about the body and nothing at all to do with the brain.
It all got down to me and the octopus.
It's all about ratings, fast cars, pretty women.
All that matters is to be with the one you love.
It's all connected.
Everything seemed very clear.
Everything's just as it should be.
It's written all over his face.
Everything I got is in the file he's reading.
It's written all over your puppy dog face.
It's written all over your face.
Everything is explained in the letter.
And I write everything down in my book. Is that understood?
It's all over their faces,
It's written all over your face - all those tics and hesitations.
Everything was as it was meant to be.
He just washed it all away.
Everything freezes,
All greased up and ready to go.
And everything is ready
I have everything.
Everything's covered,
Everything's prepared. Do not be worried.
Has everything been ready?
Is everything ready? You did get the list for the dressing room?
Is everything ready? Is the team in place?
Everything is ready, sir.
Do you have everything?
Everything is ready? Yes, father.
Is everything ready? I have the letters right here.
Is everything ready? You did get the list for the dressing room?
Everything is ready! Morphine, morphine!
Is everything ready? Now?
All is prepared. Which chosen one? What's prepared?
Everything's ready, they're all waiting and I've got this cool suit on.
Everything's prepared. I was just waiting for this.
Everything's ready, Enrique.
Everything's set. I'm heading there now.
Everything possible is on the line, including your manhood.
Is everything ready? Yep, Yep.
Everything's ready. Just take a look at it.
Everything is ready, sir. Go ahead.
Everything's ready for the quail hunt!
All things are ready if our minds be so
Everything is prepared.
Everything's ready, the room, the bathroom.
By the time the assauIt teams are in position, we'll have no idea where he is.
And so everything was set.
Everything else is good to go.
Is everything set? Huh?
All ready to mobilise, except no one's saying why.
In readiness for an immediate departure?
Getting enough of these projects up and running will take people.
All the preparations have been completed. The team is all ready.
All that's prepared and in - hand? - there is planking on the backside.
Everything's torn apart.
Evertyhing is set
It's all set.
Everything's taken care of.
All done?
It's already done. Look at you!
Guess all bets are off, huh?
Everything moved up. The board wants things done ASAP
But by then it's too late and we go at it like animaIs.
Everything is moving so quickly,
It's all being spirited away by this... Capricious man.
And was gone.
Nothing has been made clear.
Everything seems to be under control!
Everything is upside down, Henri. An old world has crumbled,
This experience was nothing but intense.
Everything is so fragile right now.
So, it's all synched up?
Took everything he had. Including the kid.
All lived. Back through life
Because it's still there, and sitting at the same table.
Everything is intact.
Everything feels a little upside - down, but I am happy for you.
Well, everything's been so expedited, you know.
Everything is going perfectly.
And everything that's happened.
I guess everything happened.
It's all happening, isn't it?
And that happens in a split second.
That all took place within the space of a pop song.
That all took place within the space of a pop song,
All of that happened to you.
It's been happening all around you
It's all set in Iceland, which is where he must've gone.
All before we started chemo.
It's all happening to me.
Everything happens right now.
Happened so fast.
This is where it all went down.
It's all about that night.
This is all happening way too fast, and I need to think.
It all happened so quickly.
Everything turned upside - down for me.
This is all happening pretty fast.
It all happened so fast.
It all happens so quickly
Everything happened so suddenly.
It all happened so fast, but now it all makes sense.
It's all happening too soon - you moving in,
everything happened quickly.
It happened so fast. It came out of nowhere.. He had that thing in his hand,
Everything happened so fast. Just like what I saw here,
I just it all happened so fast, I'm not even used to the idea yet.
That it's happening pretty fast.
It all happened so fast. That guy.
Before I knew what was happening, he put this cloth over my mouth, which had this chemical smell,
Everything's happening so fast. You've just gotta stick by me here.
It all happened so fast. It was dark.
Things are happening fast now, honey. I'm traveling a lot.
It all happened too fast. I was overwhelmed by you.
It just kind of happened.
It's all happening so fast.
Everything happened so quickly.
Everything happened in such a hurry.
No, it's just that this is all happening so quickly.
It happened so fast.
It happened so fast. You know, you been working for me for two months.
It happened pretty fast.
Where it all happens, yeah.
Everything happened so fast, I know,
The whole thing just happened so fast.
Italize in the hands of the people vote out this late and become jury members.
It's always been your choice.
All depends on what it is you're trying to teach.
It depends why you're staying.
It all depends on how you respond to my next two words.
It comes down to one thing - what you decide to do with it.
That depends on your vote.
It starts with you. I'm sure she appreciated that.
And it all starts to come down to three counties in Ohio.
Everything is resting upon it.
Everything rests with what's on that recording.
It's all up to us. We have choices -
It's all based on whether or not we have chemistry.
It's all about the desk.
Everything depends on this. Everything. Okay.
It's all what you do in the moment, baby.
It all depends on the secret.
Everything depends on it
Everything is riding on this dress.
And it all hung on a single question, is white light pure?
It's all about the powder
All that's changed.
And suddenly it was all different
everything has changed
Nothing would be the same.
Everything is different. Everything is gone. No.
It all just changed. - what?
A lot sure has changed
All is changed, sir. I must leave you.
Everything has changed... Including me.
Everything has changed.
Well, everything's changing, huh?
Things have changed. - uh - huh.
everything changes because at first,
It's really different, I.
Things have changed... And I accept that.
It changes everything. I'm gonna be up all night.
Things change. We all need to grow up, right?
Things have changed. I've changed. What do you want from me?
Everything has changed. I got lysine up and running. The virus is gone.
Everything's changed, my hairstyle most definitely
Everything just feels different. - I cann't wait to feel different.
It all went wrong, Didn't it? uh.
Everything! Yes, everything you're used to.
Things have changed, Tom.
Everything is different, Mr. Teacher. And we were afraid.
Today it's all gone. A whale shows up with $4 million in a suitcase.
There have been too many distractiss.
It's all moving kind of fast.
Everything's been spinning so fast
It's all changing so fast.
Everything went sour. She found a man her own age.
It's been more complicated than it really needs to be.
Everything felt better.
It's all good, doctor.
Everything's getting better, but he's getting sicker.
always makes it easy
Everything's different now.
Things were different.
Nothing is like it was.
Suddenly, everything made sense.
It's all gotten so... Complicated.
And it got too real, Didn't it?
It's as natural as the air we breathe.
And it's all become so.
Everything was more real and less real at the same time.
All turn out for the best.
And it's all just tedious and horrible and terrible
It quickly became clear that they could live anywhere as long as they lived together.
Everything goes crazy.
Suddenly it all became so clear.
Everything feels enormous, like it's all.
None of that seemed to matter anymore.
Everything - everything's very clear to me now.
Everything's brown and, uh - Oh, I feel sick
It was so meaningless.
Everything else fades.
That led us into chaos.
Everything mixed up. Fragmented.
All else seems inconsequential.
It all went mad!
Everything else is easy.
Everything becomes easier, and I am in, baby.
We just like made it really slow and still,
And everything's kind of awesome.
This all came hard and at the cost, I'm sure,
Things are getting even colder.
Everything get so screwed up?
It's all becoming so bland.
Everything just fell into place.
Oh everything spins from fucking control.
Everything moves faster or slower.
Everything slows down.
It remains unexplained
Everything has been broken into pieces.
Everything just turned red.
It's turned into a goddamn Whopper of a chopper opera.
I cann't avoid it anymore. It's real.
It all went up, everything.
And then everything went white.
And it got too real, Didn't it? You chickened out.
It totally makes sense, okay?
It was all gonna be simple.
And everything went bad.
Everything's more expensive now.
What happens is always and only between you and her. Do you see?
Everything was just so perfect.
I'm faking this whole thing.
It was all about the mistletoe.
It's all about the bottom line.
Everything is show biz
The whole thing's just a routine.
It's a scam, okay?
It's all circumstantial. Yeah, but it's good circumstantial.
I needed something to fill me up when I was on my own.
Everything has been a one -way street,
Anything.
Make things the way we want them to be.
Everything was understood.
I think we can start over.
And all is forgiven - ish.
Nothing that cann't be denied.
And all will be right with the world.
So things can go back to the way they were.
And everything else would work as planned.
All gonna work out.
Nothing is irreversible.
It's only gonna work if... If Whistler cooperates.
Everything's negotiable.
I'll teach you everything you need to know.
Can go back to the way it was.
Everything will be made clean again,
Everything's rideable, everything's doable in some way or another.
It all comes down to simple mathematics.
It can all end right now.
Everything could be heightened.
We'll get this sorted out right away.
We'll get this all straightened out.
I believe in second chances.
Anything but clothes?
It was going to be fine. But it ain't.
They can take everything away, these carpets, columns, houses,
Look, everything can be taken back.
Everything could have been different.
What if it was over for me, I didn't have an option to fail.
Things can be changed.
Things may change.
All these might be connected.
And anything that can be, will be, somewhere in the multiverse.
The whole thing could start again.
All things in their proper place.
Everything is where it should be.
Everything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp,
Is everything in order?
Justifiable homicide. No one's saying you're getting off,
It all made perfect sense, because that's what I saw.
Is everything legal? Yeah, it's legal, it's just.
It's the same with everything.
All is the same as before,
Way to look on the bright side.
my family is really, really happy for me.
You're in charge.
Follow her lead,
That's why you're in charge, sir.
It just seems... Listen.
Everything matches.
Everything fits: he's a Gemini and an aspiring engineer.
Everything's, uh... Is fine.
All about me.
Everything, it's telling you that this is thin and poor soil.
It's all about the team of me.
That things could be as exactly as they were before.
Everything is exactly the same.
No more than there was yesterday. Dude, you made her pancakes?
Everything's been different.
Nothing is the same as before
It's all about the burn notice with you, isn't it?
Everything's exactly as you left it.
It's all about her
This has nothing to do with Francesca and how pretty she is.
Everything's exactly the same.
Like everything our world was about to become,
Nothing's turned out like I thought.
Dramatic effect, I guess. Or perhaps I've developed a warped sense of humor.
Exactly the way it did last time.
It's all about money.
Like it comes easy for me.
Ketchup on everything, ketchup on everything
It all came apart.
And things will never be the same.
The time had come for the grand return.
Everything is back in its box.
It's going to be back the way it was.
And everything went back the way it used to be.
All's right with the world.
Everything's back to the way it used to be.
You know, like - like we're getting back to normal.
And all is right in the world.
He thought things were back to normal.
It all came back to me
It came back to me.
All because he dared to dream tonight. - Yes! Yes!
All because he dared to dream tonight. Yes! Yes!
All because of you
And all because you picked up a doctor who happens to be a fake.
All because we Didn't listen to her.
And all attributed to natural causes.
Everything started with the village.
All because of that man who came here.
It's all the goddamned money.
It's all the goddamn money, ed Tom. Money and the drugs.
Everything feels so different with you here.
A lot of this is because of you.
What, all this come down to just jealousy?
It was all caused by my dreams.
Which is all because of me. So let's face it, I owe you.
I'm the reason this happened. Not you.
This all started when I began my affair with Vanessa.
Everything comes to he who fights.
Everything comes to he who fights, my friend.
It begins with a dream
Everything always come back to that.
All around you, the power of God is pushing out of a community which is
Ah, it shouldn't always be about science.
Everything's all.
Nothing's gone.
It contains everything.
Everything is... Happening.
Hey, it's all about choices.
It's all about forgiveness.
It's in the heartbeat.
It's all about the details.
Everything happens today.
So everything is on the line for me today.

He had it all planned years in advance.
All set to the rhythm of the hot Latin sound.

Everything's going my way. I made partner - junior partner.
Everything is taken care of.
Things were definitely looking up.
It was going fine.We were making it.
Everything stays right where it is.
Things are under control at the office.
Properly under operating conditions.
And it all starts right here in Detroit -
So everything was running into each other
Everything works, she can hear,
He knows how it ends.
Everything's the same. One security guard.
It was completely unexpected.
and it's getting better all the time
Our political bets were entirely well - placed.

The situation is under control.
Everything is in my name, the car, the house.
I watch that world pass by.
That I was the one in charge.
I had it under control - people were laughing at us.
I made them, and now you're handing my master over to me.
It is under my control.
And I'm sitting right on top of it.
I've anticipated everything down to the last detail.
I've got it under control. - you've got nothing.
Everything will end just as I planned.
I'll handle everything
I've got everyone under control.
I got it all under control.
I've got this under control, and it's not gonna end in disaster.
I got this under control. What are you talking about?

It's all part of the plan.
I've thought of everything.
things flying around the room.
It's all in the greeting.

Everything changes. That's the one constant.
Everything's in the order of the order of things.
Right in the everyday stuff. And that's what this is for
And everything is right on track.
Everything's in the future.
Grace has that situation well under control, fine,
Here at the end of all things.
It's all slotting into place.
Everything's on the beach.
Everything's off.
All in the game, yo.
And romantically fixated from nothing more than one fleeting glance.
It's all burning.
All in the name of love.
Everything was... Physically appealing,
Everything grows wild, Cole.
It... It all happened really fast.
everything is waiting
Everything's waiting for you
Everything keeps going. Nature of life.
All overseen by the United States of America.
Everything is on the table.
It's like a test. The whole thing is like one big test.
Just what you have in your head, right?
All will be swell, soon as mother's refreshed.
Things continue to reveal themselves.
It's right out of a gossamer book. don't talk. Listen.
Everything stops the day before the funeral,
Everything here is within operational arguments.
Down in position.
Something is destroying everything.
Everything just fell apart.
The police have it under control.
Everything is going to schedule.
All went down as planned.
All part of the plan, yes?
All part of my plan.
All part of the plan, master.
All part of the plan, yes? Exactly.
It's on the way, bro.
To the point of certainty.
It's all on track.
Well, this just keeps getting better
Everything is jumping.
Everything's dancing.
Everything keeps going around in a circle to the same dark end.
It's going to be okay. We're going to be fine.
Everything's just turning and turning about until you just fall to the ground.
It's all here, everything.
It ends here. For you and the police, maybe.
Everything's here, just as you left it.
It's everything.
Just to wind up here, today, without her,
Everything is explained here.
It ends here!
Here at the end of all things.
That it ends here, in a health food restaurant on sunset Boulevard.
All you do is get in the way.
Everything is in motion. Can we count on you?
This'll work.
It worked every time.
Everything happened to be there.
No, where it all begins, Mr. Pire.
Where everything dissolves,
And everything is possible, again.
Everything is on that.
It shows everything.
It's all in there.
Everything that blocks our path to what we desire.
It's all in the crust.
There's no shocker there. Well, I'm not done.
Entirely according to plan.
Things were changing quickly.
Everything falIs in.
Everything is based on his work.
Everything was pretty much over.
I've laid all the groundwork, and tomorrow,
Which puts everything in danger, everything!
Nothing's getting done until your way out of this becomes clear.
Everything taken care of?
Everything's taken care of, but l'm reluctant to talk on the phone.
Everything's been handled. We're clear to go.
It's all been taken care of.
You did everything right.
Do we have everything we need... Let's see.
This complicates everything.
it's all wrong. It wasn't supposed to be like this.
All was right with the world.
Everything's so different.
Everything fits together perfectly
It's just so unfair.
This isn't even right.
It's not really real, is it? Do you know what I mean?
It's just so goddamn bright, isn't it?
Thinking it was just all very shocking.
Everything was on the line.
The whole thing is ridiculous.
It's too complicated.
It's just so complicated and confusing.
Everything's too big. Yeah, it's too big.
This whole business is insane! You know me.
Time's gone all weird... That's it. I'm outta here.
Everything's great.
Everything is fabulous.
Everything worked out so perfectly.
It's just all too smooth to be true.
All too well, it was our plan.
All is so perfectly, damnably well!
It was way too easy, way too convenient.
It was just - it was too weird.
Everything's moving kinda fast.
It's just - it's too much too soon.
It just happened so fast, and then I saw this thing coming at me, like - like a monster.
It just goes so fast, you know?
all this is too strange.
It was all too horrible. I had to avert my eyes.
It's all moot.
It's all a little too neat.
It's too early for all that.
But it cann't be helped.
It was too late, and.
It's a little late now, isn't it?
It's too late, Jamal. Now go.
Everything is super good.
It's amazing, because you go through so many different things.
It's all so unresolved?
It's just all kinds of messed up.
It was may hem, general chaos.
It's all too clear. Obvious.
All this is damn exciting.
Does that make it any less real?
It was all very fascinating.
This is all very strange.
That things are moving too fast.
The circumstances have changed suddenly,
It all happened fast.
All of a sudden, there's a corpse outside? Bad idea.
It's all very neat and easy.
It was all too easy.
Everything is collapsing, it's very sad.
It's all been awful.
And that's just fine.
Is just fantastic!
It could not have happened better.
Everything's vulnerable. Everything.
It's all too neat, too easy.
It's almost too good to be true
And it was too late.
It's too late for me too. David. It's too late.
I'm going to go find the queen.
It's too late. I've already read more than one book. All right, come on.
Everything's so new
Everything's been so hard.
It had all been too easy.
And it all spiraled out of control
Everything is just spinning out of control,
Everything's got out of control.
Will have been for nothing.
Everything seemed meaningless,
Everything was out of control. I Didn't know what the hell to do.
All hell broke loose, and when the blood boils.
And everything is going out of control.
And they've gone wrong!
Everything was out of control
Things have gotten so out of hand. I broke my first bundle cake.
It's out of control, and it's my fault.
The whole thing was a complete failure.
Yes everything is alright. Bye, see you.
All good, indeed.
All the best!

Everything. Just like you asked.
There's something about the sunshine.
Something about the sunshine, baby
There's something about the sunshine, baby.
It fell out as Sherlock Holmes had predicted.
Everything will turn beautiful
As you wished it so did it come to pass.
Everything is proceeding to your plan.
You are getting everything you wanted!
We've got everything exactly the way we want it.
It happened just how I always imagined it would.
Big whirlwind with the movie and the tour.
Everything seems unreal.
Anything at all. Sorry.
So amusing
And everything's a big mess. And I have vomit boots!
Oh. Everything is exquisite.
Everything was so lovely, even the weather cooperated.
The excitement of it all.
It was all so smooth.
Lost waters.
Everything, as arranged. Angelo.
Everything's got to be big and flashy.
Make everything all right
So it all worked out.
Got everything? Yeah. Here.
Everything's flushing great.
Looks like you're all set.
It all started a year and a half ago.
It all started out so innocently
It all started one day five years ago.
It all began five years into my life sentence
It started with us in l. A.
It all starts on the ultraviolet line.
It all began one night
We're all clear.
Everything's secure. Thanks, man.
Everything is perfectly safe.
Everything's secure. - thanks, man.
Everything is okay.
Everything all right? No.
Everything looks secure here, ma 'am.
To a time when things were right.
Everything is peace, old guy!
all settled down.
It was the opposite of chaos,
All the arrangements are made.
Everything is arranged,
It's already organised
It's all arranged. You're expected in the surgeon's room in 30 seconds.
Everything's set. He was very nice.
I made the call, so it's okay.
Has everything been arranged?
Has everything been arranged? Yes.
Everything set up, what?
It is all arranged. I will have your luggage sent for.
It was all worked out. I thought my luck had finally turned.
Everything is arranged. The ark is on board.
It's alright, Petey, it's alright.
Everything was planned, bought and paid for.
It's all set. Thank you.
I'll call in as soon as I know everything's okay.
Everything's secure and everyone's accounted for?
It's been entirely... Uneventful.
Everything's all right, yes, everything
All saddled in and happy, are we then, sir?
All is calm
Things are gonna quiet down. It's gonna get easier.
When things settle down, can you contact Kim for me?
All of this would fall apart.
And total ruin.
Everything ended!
Everything is destroyed! Everything!
It's all over. They've heard it all, Burke.
Everything is ruined. You made me kill someone I cared about over nothing.
It's over! Get out!
It is finished?
It's all over. Fuck's sake!
It's gonna be all right, Nan. Just close your eyes.
Forget it. Just... Mom.
All is finished. Why tell me this?
It's not gonna matter. Descend now!
It's gone, and I cann't get it back.
Its over, Larry.
I'm screwed. The deal is tomorrow.
So this is the end, huh?
It's all over, Eddie.
Everything's screwed up, dad.
everything would come apart.
It's over, Gail. There's no fighting them
That's finished. It's over. It's finished with. Over.
Oh, it's over, daddy. Hey.
It's over, dodge. It's time to pack it up and go home.
Anything that is physically possible actually does occur.
And everything seemed perfectly normal.
Everything's exactly the same, except for the bird.
But I would've done anything.
Well, everything come off all right? Tell me.
When everything is ended, then you come.
All is perfect.
And everything is perfect,
Everything was going perfectly.
Everything's perfect.
Everything ended up fine.
And everything, all hell broke loose.
It's all over.
Everything is finalized. So - so when do we meet the mother?
Actually, everything checks out in there.
Everything was much easier.
You were right about everything.
It fits, doesn't it?
Nothing is insignificant.
Everything that is at all good in me,
He's got an answer for everything.
Everything's going to be different, and I'm so scared.
Would be long - buried in the past.
It's all and it is turn off.
Everything's falling apart, the crisis and all,
All that was for nothing.
And nothing will ever be the same.
Things are going to be different.
Everything's about to turn to crap.
And everything shall be as it was
It will be completely different in just 40 years time.
It all ends tonight.
It's all come down to this.
This is all that would be left of us.
Nothing will make sense
And it'll be business as usual, okay?
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant.
Nothing will return to normal.
And it will be back to business as usual.
He won't be able to do any of them.
Everything has been pointing me towards something good.
Everything's coming together right on schedule.
Everything is gonna change.
Everything is about to change for you.
Everything will be different.
Everything will be very nice
The resuIt could be anarchy.
This is where we're going to start again.
Events are closing.
It all ends here. Tonight.
Everything will go on as it is,
Nothing would survive. Not even bacteria.
It's going to burn and you
It's all gonna burn, and you're gonna be nothing but bleached skulls.
An airing will do me a great deal of good, I'm sure.
It'd be just like old times.
All due respect to you,
It's wrapped up with a bow on top.
Everything Was set.
It's all falling into place.
Everything is set, exhausted, the point made, perfect
Everything set up, gentlemen? Just about.
The table's been set: let's get to the main course.
I'd pretty much seen and done everything.
I'm the one with all the lines.
Exactly as it should be.
Everything belongs to me.
Everything was on the line. If she turned you in, your life would be ruined.
I mean, everything is just falling apart.
Everything's down. Which means what?
Then it all went wrong.
The stage is set.
Ready to go. Yeah, lieutenant.
two hours of surgency
For the lines of convergence are being drawn across the earth, even now.

But this is all be a long time coming.
Everything's ready. He knows the metro like the back of his hand.
You know, everything is working.
Attendance is up, giving is up, we've got the best music in town.
It won't make any difference, Helen.
I'm all set.
Could take no hold upon him.
Money is about the bottom line.

Look, things have changed.

Everything is going as planned.
That it's over, sir.
Now everything is settled.

Everything just happens, right?
And that should be enough.
It's already too late
It was already too late.
It's all been taken care of. Oh?
Everything's arranged. Good, good, good.
Everything is done and everything is absolutely flawless.
Everything is positioning nicely.
It's all starting to happen.
Things have changed.
Nothing's the same around here anyway. Nothing's the way it used to be!
Everything's known, everything's determined.
And this whoIe thing is over.
That was just over. She was hiding.
Everyone has the feeling it's all be done before.
They're scripted very tightly.
It's all planned to work out.
All that's confirmed.
Now that time has gone by.
She made everything beautiful.
All clean and when the gertrudes come home,
And they's just fine.
Evertyhing's fine. It's not. He's setting us up.
Everything is peaceful.
You know, relationships are easy when everything runs nice and smooth.
And it was all rainbows and unicorns.
That should not change.
Everything had to be perfect.
Everything should be fine.
Yet all shall be forgot.
Things have to be perfect.
It's all kicking off now.
It all started in the new York public library.
Things are really starting to take shape, and I'm blossoming! Really, I am!
That's when it all started happening.
After her big break. Where's LAN? lan!
After her big break. Where's LAN? LAN!
It's all starting to come true.
Everything started shaking.
Everything started spinning, and then I was just standing there,
Everything blurred, head or tails
Everything has started to click.
Wheels are in motion.
Things were just starting to come together.
Nothing makes any sense any more.
I mean, everything turns upside down.
It was all taken care of.
it's all clear. False alarm.
All of which leads to the most frightening question of all.
Joe gets everything and you don't.
Everything's back in place.
Everytng's the way it's supposed to be.
Anything, you got it.
All to you.
All started 'cause you jumped off a building.
It will be because of her.
And we owe it all to me!
Well, all credit goes to this lady on my left.
And that's what it all comes down to.
That's what started all of this. But then I realized,
I'm taking everything
It all comes down to this challenging night of competition.
And everything gets cleaned away.
It all got turned upside down, Didn't it?
Everything pointed at the opposite.
And everything is just... Perfect.
It's getting weird in here.
None of this seems right. I mean, who are you?
It's all great.
Everything looks good and keep your eyes.
Things are going great.
Everything is not in order
About everything that's going wrong,
And they are very ritualistic
It was all worth it, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
Everything... Very pageanty.
Everything was fake, disingenuous.
All fair and square.
And this is all so weird.
Everything was so rushed.
It's just - it's been a whirlwind.
All in due time. Lovely. Yes. Blow.
it all makes sense.
It all sounds very reasonable, doesn't it?
And, you know, everything just kind of lines up, it's really magical.
It's all pretty weird.
All is good.
Everything is all right ~
Everything is great as it is
Everything's fine.
Everything was going well,
Oh, everything is fine.
Everything's fine. Wow, everything's fine?

Everything's gonna be okay. Let's just get inside.
Well, what's all that?
Everything's all right? Are you fucking kidding me?
All's well, little brother.
Is everything in order? - I suggest the ordering of coal.
Everything's all right, brother, I got you, bam - bam.
Everything under control, I see.
Everything's good. Yeah, yeah.
Everything looks great, what's the big deal?

All is well, miss Ellison.
Everything's fine.
Everything was fine until 3 months ago
Everything was fine until three months ago.
Funny how everything was cool until you bitches came in.
Everything was going good until she said those words.
And that was fine, until we hit turbulence.
And all that shit is just fine until one day it ain't.
Everything was cool till around - around midnight.
Everything's been going so well Until this.
Look, I had everything under control till you led us down here!
It's gonna be fine. Watch. Thank you.

Everything looks good. All these nice rolls
Everything's all right. You see, it wasn't her.
It's all good. So, I'm saying, where.
Everything's fine. All is well.
It's all good.
Everything except for the part
Everything, except her ex is in town.
Everything was, uh, really good. Really good.
Everything - the food, the wine.
Everything was SOP.
Everything's in order. If you'll just endorse this there.
Everything was done properly. John!
But it's all right.
All quiet.
all is perfect.
Everything perfect.
Everything's going awesome,
You really are pretty everything!
Everything should be perfect, right?
Everything is exquisite. But I've come to expect nothing less from you.
It was perfect, but what's more important,
Everything was perfect. Why did you have to ruin it?
Everything is just perfect. You are recovering quite nicely.
Is everything perfect?
Is this absolutely fabulous?
Everything's just terrific, mother.
Everything's just terrific, mother. Thank you.
Everything looks nice, right? It looks nice.
Everything was perfect
All of that is hot and dope and cool, but take some risks, man.
Everything all right? - very good.
Everything all right? Very good.
I mean, it was perfect. "Perfect." I'll go along with that.
Everything was perfect. And I Didn't care.
All things gone okay. Yes?
Everything was perfect and then suddenly, it just all went wrong?
Everything's perfect. The men are a total disaster.
All perfect, without slips. As I like it
It was perfect, except for one thing.
Flying around, everything is so small, everything goes by so fast.
Everything neat. Clean.
It was nothing unusual.
And everything is white and calm.
Things stay quiet, I'd be up for anything.
Everything's quiet, Charlie.
Everything seemed cool until their leader came back
Leaving everything in the open? That's right!
It's perfectly legit.
It was so, so perfect.
It was very peaceful.
It was done with quickly.
And this is very strange, because
Everything is weird.
Everything fucking sucks.
All very grown up.
Power everything.
All relaxed and not angry.
Everything was clean.
Well, it's as good as new.
It all feels... It feels so new.
Everything is at hand, the floor, the walls, the telephone.
Everything's clear. Everyone's happy
Everything was really bright.
Like it all makes sense.
It's all such fun.
Everything's funny.
It was all kind of, uh... Kind of hazy.
Everything's wonderful.
Yeah, everything looks wonderful. doesn't everything look wonderful?
Everything's so nice. Thanks.
Everything seems to be a blur.
It's all a blur,
And all is right with the world.
Everything's calm here, right?
Nothing's going crazy or nothing.
No more than usual. Yeah. No, I hear that.
It was normal. You know? Nothing freaky.
This is totally normal not a problem here this is just a monster with me
This is totally normal, not a problem here. This is just a monster with me.
Everything was fine until Lizzie got detention.
That is right up until she walked inon her girlfriend in flagrante with one of her North koreanbusiness partners.
Everything is in the green. I mean, it's working great.
Nothing, except for the hives.
Instead of it flowing through the arm, it just stops dead and hangs down there like that.
The Humvee got messed up bad.
It's been a crazy time, at home with Sarah and all.
And it was really just a mess.
Everything's clear.
It's all clear,
So it was pretty clear that
So, now you know everything.
So we're clear, I have a boyfriend.
Satisfied. Then you walk in.
Everything is erotic. Girls.
Everything was familiar.
It's all very modern the media is safe and many believe it's wise to be silent
There is nothing I don't cherish!
Uh, and everything about it, the way you played the two different characters.
Like everything is finally real.
It was very sudden.
Well, it all happened so fast.
All very simple.
Everything's simple. I mean, you don't play games.
And said was too elaborate, but that's what he did.
It all sucks.
I hated everything.
So it was always very tight.
Everything's moving slowly but happening so quickly, too.
Everything's beautiful.
It's beautiful and so are you
Everything was delicious.
And everything was Amazing.
Everything is good
Everybody should share equally.
It was a joyous occasion until.
It's all fun and games until the judges start giving scores.
It was wonderful.
Everything's pretty old.
Everything's vulnerable. Everything.
You like Lili and she likes you.
It's all natural, and we have spoken about that dress.
Things are tough all over.
That was very hard, and right now we're still trying to recover.
It all seems so crazy.
It was all superficial. Completely about sex.
Everything was just... Mad.
Nothing made sense.
Everything looks excellent.
Everything's incredibIe, ma. I just wanted to tell you I Iove you.
Everything's incredible, ma. I just wanted to tell you I love you.
Yeah, everything's great. good.
Everything's hot.
Everything is cool because you're a famous skateboarder, huh?
What happens matters.
It's very... Foreign.
All in good time, son.
And everything seem to proceed for the best
And, you know, everything was going great,
Everything was fine.
All is well. Everything is in the hands of your most devoted.
Is everything OK?
And with them always and all was right and proper.
It was going well. They worked at Madame Arthur.
It was like clockwork. They're real pros, man.
Did okay. They're happy.
Everything is going really good, you know?
And everything was on time, except for you.
All well and good, but what do we know about fashion?
Well, that went well, I think.
I thought the whole thing went pretty well, yeah?
Things are going well,
And it works' cause I trust you and I know you want what's best for us.
Everything is gonna be just fine, if that's what you mean.
That was great, right?
Everything is great as it is.
Everything worked. It's in the bag.
This all goes well, we might have a future together.
Things went so well, we took an after - dinner stroll.
Everything was going good, and then.
Everything's perfect; more than enough time.
So, uh, just ride out the trip, okay?
Everything is fine. Just a few last - minute touch - ups.
Everything was going great until three nights ago.
Everything good till they locked my ass away.
Everything go all right, buddy?
Anything goes, and the auditions rocked.
Now it is all working. Get it together.
Everything to hand - developing dishes here, toning bath here, whole - plate enlarger.
It's just, sometimes when things are going really good for me,
It's a lost cause.
We need to do things strictly by the book.
It all started because I went to see her
But, so......This is new.
You must pay for everything: the toilet, custody, and it's 350 pesos per each.
All must end in blood.
Must all end in blood?
You have to earn what you get.
Everything happens with the flick of a switch.
It all has to happen exactly like it happened.
It's got to be snuff.
And it's all thanks to the existence of this fragile staircase.
It's about you taking control.
Everything needs to be destroyed.
Until we prove ourselves, it's hard to be like, "trust me",
Run everything by me.
Everything runs through me, no exceptions, and I get full credit.
We had to start all over.
And wanna a brand new start
It will all have to be redone. All of it.
So much depends on you.
It was always up to you.
Pounding the pavement is not a luxury that I get.
Everything must be done in the most expeditious manner.
Everything's gotta be perfect.
Things have to hold up.
Everything must be exactly how I've envisioned.
Everything must be exactly how I envisioned it.
Everything must go
Could all be combined.
It was very quick, guy. She wasn't hurt in any way.
Everything was flaming out of control.
We're almost to the end, folks.
Everything is so now with end.
It felt really sexy.
It was him. The false prophet. He killed you.
Fuck you for happening.
You'll be blaming us. Get the door.
Blames me for everything.
I blamed her for everything.
Everything was back to normal.
That's all back to the way it belongs as well.
Yeah. So everything's... Everything's okay.
It's good to have everything back.
Everything went back to normal.
Everything's back in order.
Everything seems to be right on track.
Everything will be right back where it was. Right, sweet buddy?
The world's back to normal, that's all. No, it isn't.
Everything came back fine. You're good to go.
And everything should return to normal.
It all went back to shit!
When everything is... Right in the world?
Everything so exact, down to the smallest detail, you know?
Everything is on the line.
Everything's leveraged to the hilt. That means no credit cards, no cash, nada.
It's so up in the air.
Had it all worked out.
Nothing feels... Solid.
The way that they slow everything down,
Everything was late, and those guys just don't want to work.
Things are heating up.
Everythings slowly starting to wither away.
It was over.
It all became my fault,
Things seem a little up in the air, and you're wondering how you fit in.
Into reality.
It's all happening, you know?
It's a beginning, not an end.
Everything is packed and ready.
All in the name of a good story or compelling television.
Good riddance, goodbye.
All signs point to hot hybrid vampire sex.
Everything points to Iran. we should keep looking.
It all pointed to this man
Everything points to your submarine being detected.
Everything pointed to some kind ofobstruction or distress.
Everything supports that he was here for the bombing. There was a time discrepancy.
Everything led to here! Hah!
All right, everything points to home invasion.
It all points to the perfume
it'll be just like we planned.
Everything is going according to my plan.
Everything's on course.
Everything's been cleared out like a stage.
Things are organized following a model, a scheme, a logical series.
Everything you planned is coming to pass.
Standard formation to start, but if there's a baby on board,
All through the advice of fortune - tellers.
Is everything going to plan?
Everything's going right ahead on schedule, anyway.
It was all going according to plan.
Everything's going according to plan. All we need is the girl.
Reformed exactly as planned.
So everything's gone to plan?
Everything is proceeding as planned.
And that everything is running on schedule.
Everything went exactly according to plan, Hendricks.
Everything according to plan. Right you are, Mr Deane.
Is everything on schedule?
Nature's taking its course. We can just relax.
Everything went according to plan until we made for the exit rendezvous.
Everything is proceeding as planned. Mobilize the ops.
Everything is in order. All except one thing.
And do everything according to post office regulations.
It's like clockwork.
Everything is goingaccording to plan.
Everything's going to plan, and then one day, outta nowhere,
Everything stands in my way.
Everyth - everything's fine.
Everything go okay?
We were doing fine.
Everything good? Yes, good.
Everything was perfect. Thank you.
Everything's so pink.
You know, everything was cool, and then today you're acting kinda weird.
It's all working out so good, right?
Everything just turned to color.
And everything depends on how you vote.
It's all in the hands of God.
All in the hands of the Indian government.
It is in our hands.
everything's under control.
Everything's worked out in advance.
Everything's all set.
Things are good?
Everything's OK, you give us a sign.
Everything's OK.
We got things all cleaned up around here?
Everything worked out. Sure did.
It is over, father. We've done it.
Everything clearly - plants - you want plants?
When this is all done, I promise,
Everything's okay! But it won't be okay.
And there we go. And that will hold my main meal pot very nicely.
Everything's ruined.
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And screw up so badly it affects your whole life?
Everything's messed up. Remember? I came to your house
That came out all wrong.
Everything fell apart.
Everything's just fallen apart.
nothing holds together, nothing makes a better sense now.
And no one and nothing can change that.
And everything changed.
And it changed everthing
And nothing can ever be the same again.
Everything changed,
Everything has changed -
That changes everything, doesn't it?
You know, things have changed. You've changed me.
This blows up completely, becomes infinite.
Things changed when we kissed.
Everything I say to myself is changed.
And it changed everything - my soul, my consciousness,
Everything changed. And then... You.
It changes everything. The contest is a few days away.
And everything's changed, except you, 'cause you're stiII here.
It's all changed so much.
Everything's all broken.
Everything's in precise order.
Things slow down.
Everything's - hey, relax, okay?
Everything's falling apart. No order anymore.
Everything's falling apart. Luckily, the guys.
Everything arranged coldly on shelves is what I thought.
Is it all ready? Right!
In the peacefulness and regularity of things.
Everything was untraceable, including the truck.
It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters anymore!
Well, it's okay.
It all seemed rather pointless.
Everything is here for you.
Not going to replace you.
It's too overwhelming. My dear, what you need is a relationship.
It's not going to work out.
Everything feels out of control.
If you're not in the same room.
Nothing can escape it, even light,
That this was going to happen
Progress, regress each step's a climb so I take that test and testify
You never know what's around the corner, do you?
This would be all useless.
And everything's clear now.
So the stars just kind of lined up.
All is bright
That explains everything.
And that's all over with.
That's all it takes is a touch.
One day everything's a lie, you wanna drive?
It's all gone wrong.
It's all a crazy game
All it took was once.
Everything is a habit.
Everything happens for a reason. I like that.
In heaven all things will be arranged.
All is in God's hands.
It's God's will.
There but for the grace of God.
Everything is God's doing!
Everything unchanging, perpetual.
It's all unforgivable.
All things are not knowable
None of it was real.
And it was just instinctual.
It's all been given to you - and you feel guilty about it!
Everything was always professional. Completely professional.
Everything does - everything good.
It's all just a big misunderstanding.
It's all lies, I swear to you.
All just a dream,
It's all mumbo - jumbo. He's just a filthy man.
Everything is a joke.
Was a joke, but, you know, they really ate it up,
Is everything else a lie?
It's a road map.
This was all a mistake.
It was a mistake. I shouldn't have gone.
It's all been a lie, hasn't it?
Jen: the whole thing was so last minute.
That it comes down to God, gold, and glory.
It will be for the chairman.
Carried out by the defendant to accomplish a revenge murder.
It's all for today.
Everything was to be for you -
It's all there for you.
I've done it all for you, sister, dear!
everything has set just for you and me to meet now.
All for your carnal pleasure.
all the respects for to you wife.
It's all for you, sir.
All to protect their bottom line.
All the preparations are in order!
A tax break is a tax break is a tax break.
It's all set to expedite the new shipments.
And everything to do with the client in crisis.
This is about development, short and simple.
It's all about relationships with the Japanese.
It's all about the greater good.
With you, it's all about the byline.
Well, anything for the birthday girl. Thank you.
